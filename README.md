# discoal
discoal is a coalescent simulation program capable of simulating models with recombination, selective sweeps, and demographic changes including population splits and admixture events.

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at [https://discoal.readthedocs.io](https://discoal.readthedocs.io)

The documentation includes:
- Installation instructions
- Detailed usage guides and examples
- Complete parameter reference
- Advanced features and workflows

A PDF version is also available in `discoaldoc.pdf`.

## Quick Start

To install discoal, clone this repository, cd into the directory, then assuming you have gcc and make installed on your system, simply type `make discoal`.

For a quick reference, typing `./discoal` will bring up a verbose usage statement:
```
$ ./discoal
usage: discoal sampleSize numReplicates nSites -ws tau
parameters:
	 -t theta
	 -r rho (=zero if not specified)
	 -g conversionRate tractLengthMean (gene conversion)
	 -gr conversionToCrossoverRatio tractLengthMean (gene conversion where initiation rate = rho*conversionToCrossoverRatio)
	 -p npops sampleSize1 sampleSize2 etc.
	 -en time popnID size (changes size of popID)
	 -ed time popnID1 popnID2 (joins popnID1 into popnID2)
	 -ea time daughterPopnID founderPopnID1 founderPopnID2 admixProp (admixture-- back in time daughterPopnID into two founders)
	 -ws tau (sweep happend tau generations ago- stochastic sweep)
	 -wd tau (sweep happend tau generations ago- deterministic sweep)
	 -wn tau (sweep happend tau generations ago- neutral sweep)
	 -ls tau leftRho (stochastic sweep some genetic distance to the left of the simulated window--specified by leftRho=4Nr)
		 similarly, ld and ln simulate deterministic and neutral sweeps to the left of the window, respectively
	 -f first frequency at which selection acts on allele (F0; sweep models only)
	 -uA rate at which adaptive mutation recurs during the sweep phase (sweep models only)
	 -N sweepEffectivePopnSize (sweep models only)
	 -a alpha (=2Ns)
	 -x sweepSite (0-1)
	 -c partialSweepFinalFrequency (partial sweeps)
	 -i dt (sweep time increment scalar; default 400 -> 1/400N)
	 -M migRate (sets all rates to migRate)
	 -m popnID1 popnID2 migRate (sets migRate from popnID1 to popnID2)
	 -A sampleSize popnID time (ancient sample from popnID at specified time)
	 -Pt low high (prior on theta)
	 -Pr low high (prior on rho)
	 -Pre mean upperBound (prior on rho -- exponentially distributed but truncated at an upper bound)
	 -Pa low high (prior on alpha)
	 -Pu low high (prior on tau; sweep models only; still must use "-ws tau" and "tau" will be ignored)
	 -PuA low high (prior on uA; sweep models only)
	 -Px low high (prior on sweepSite; sweep models only)
	 -Pf low high (prior on F0; sweep models only)
	 -Pc low high (prior on partialSweepFinalFreq; sweep models only)
	 -Pe1 lowTime highTime lowSize highSize (priors on first demographic move time and size)
	 -Pe2 lowTime highTime lowSize highSize (priors on second demographic move time and size)
	 -R rhhRate (recurrent hitch hiking mode at the locus; rhh is rate per 2N individuals / generation)
	 -L rhhRate (recurrent hitch hiking mode to the side of locus; leftRho is ~Unif(0,4Ns); rhh is rate per 2N individuals / generation)
	 -h (hide selected SNP in partial sweep mode)
	 -T (tree output mode)
	 -d seed1 seed2 (set random number generator seeds)
```
