# Project Policy

This policy provides a single, authoritative, and machine-readable source of truth for AI coding agents and humans, ensuring that all work is governed by clear, unambiguous rules and workflows. It aims to eliminate ambiguity, reduce supervision needs, and facilitate automation while maintaining accountability and compliance with best practices.

# 1. Introduction

> Rationale: Sets the context, actors, and compliance requirements for the policy, ensuring all participants understand their roles and responsibilities.

## 1.1 Actors

> Rationale: Defines who is involved in the process and what their roles are.

- **User**: The individual responsible for defining requirements, prioritising work, approving changes, and ultimately accountable for all code modifications.
- **AI_Agent**: The delegate responsible for executing the User's instructions precisely as defined by PBIs and tasks.

## 1.2 Architectural Compliance

> Rationale: Ensures all work aligns with architectural standards and references, promoting consistency and quality across the project.

- **Policy Reference**: This document adheres to the AI Coding Agent Policy Document.
- **Includes**:
  - All tasks must be explicitly defined and agreed upon before implementation.
  - All code changes must be associated with a specific task.
  - All PBIs must be aligned with the PRD when applicable.

# 2. Fundamental Principles

> Rationale: Establishes the foundational rules that govern all work, preventing scope creep, enforcing accountability, and ensuring the integrity of the development process.

## 2.1 Core Principles

> Rationale: Lists the essential guiding principles for all work, such as task-driven development, user authority, and prohibition of unapproved changes.

1. Task-Driven Development: No code shall be changed in the codebase unless there is an agreed-upon task explicitly authorising that change.
2. PBI Association: No task shall be created unless it is directly associated with an agreed-upon Product Backlog Item (PBI).
3. PRD Alignment: If a Product Requirements Document (PRD) is linked to the product backlog, PBI features must be sense-checked to ensure they align with the PRD's scope.
4. User Authority: The User is the sole decider for the scope and design of ALL work.
5. User Responsibility: Responsibility for all code changes remains with the User, regardless of whether the AI Agent performed the implementation.
6. Prohibition of Unapproved Changes: Any changes outside the explicit scope of an agreed task are EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED.
7. Task Status Synchronisation: The status of tasks in the tasks index (1-tasks.md) must always match the status in the individual task file. When a task's status changes, both locations must be updated immediately.
8.  **Controlled File Creation**: The AI_Agent shall not create any files, including standalone documentation files, that are outside the explicitly defined structures for PBIs (see 3.6), tasks (see 4.3), or source code, unless the User has given explicit prior confirmation for the creation of each specific file. This principle is to prevent the generation of unrequested or unmanaged documents.
9. **External Package Research and Documentation**: For any proposed tasks that involve external packages, to avoid hallucinations, use the web to research the documentation first to ensure it's 100% clear how to use the API of the package. Then for each package, a document should be created `<task id>-<package>-guide.md` that contains a fresh cache of the information needed to use the API. It should be date-stamped and link to the original docs provided. E.g., if pg-boss is a library to add as part of task 2-1 then a file `tasks/2-1-pg-boss-guide.md` should be created. This documents foundational assumptions about how to use the package, with example snippets, in the language being used in the project.
10. **Task Granularity**: Tasks must be defined to be as small as practicable while still representing a cohesive, testable unit of work. Large or complex features should be broken down into multiple smaller tasks.
11. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Information should be defined in a single location and referenced elsewhere to avoid duplication and reduce the risk of inconsistencies. Specifically:
    - Task information should be fully detailed in their dedicated task files and only referenced from other documents.
    - PBI documents should reference the task list rather than duplicating task details.
    - The only exception to this rule is for titles or names (e.g., task names in lists).
    - Any documentation that needs to exist in multiple places should be maintained in a single source of truth and referenced elsewhere.
12. **Use of Constants for Repeated or Special Values**: Any value (number, string, etc.) used more than once in generated code—especially "magic numbers" or values with special significance—**must** be defined as a named constant.
    - Example: Instead of `for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { ... }`, define `const numWebsites = 10;` and use `for (let i = 0; i < numWebsites; i++) { ... }`.
    - All subsequent uses must reference the constant, not the literal value.
    - This applies to all code generation, automation, and manual implementation within the project.
13. **Technical Documentation for APIs and Interfaces**: As part of completing any PBI that creates or modifies APIs, services, or interfaces, technical documentation must be created or updated explaining how to use these components. This documentation should include:
    - API usage examples and patterns
    - Interface contracts and expected behaviors  
    - Integration guidelines for other developers
    - Configuration options and defaults
    - Error handling and troubleshooting guidance
    - The documentation must be created in the appropriate location (e.g., `docs/technical/` or inline code documentation) and linked from the PBI detail document.
## 2.2 PRD Alignment Check

All PBIs must be checked for alignment with the PRD. Any discrepancies must be raised with the User.

## 2.3 Integrity and Sense Checking

All data must be sense-checked for consistency and accuracy.

## 2.4 Scope Limitations

> Rationale: Prevents unnecessary work and keeps all efforts focused on agreed tasks, avoiding gold plating and scope creep.

- No gold plating or scope creep is allowed.
- All work must be scoped to the specific task at hand.
- Any identified improvements or optimizations must be proposed as separate tasks.

## 2.5 Change Management Rules

> Rationale: Defines how changes are managed, requiring explicit association with tasks and strict adherence to scope.

- Conversation about any code change must start by ascertaining the linked PBI or Task before proceeding.
- All changes must be associated with a specific task.
- No changes should be made outside the scope of the current task.
- Any scope creep must be identified, rolled back, and addressed in a new task.
- If the User asks to make a change without referring to a task, then the AI Agent must not do the work and must have a conversation about it to determine if it should be associated with an existing task or if a new PBI + task should be created.

# 3. Product Backlog Item (PBI) Management

> Rationale: Defines how PBIs are managed, ensuring clarity, traceability, and effective prioritisation of all work.

## 3.1 Overview

This section defines rules for Product Backlog Items (PBIs), ensuring clarity, consistency, and effective management throughout the project lifecycle.

## 3.2 Backlog Document Rules

> Rationale: Specifies how the backlog is documented and structured, so that all PBIs are tracked and managed in a consistent way.

- **Location Pattern**: docs/delivery/backlog.md
- **Scope Purpose Description**: The backlog document contains all PBIs for the project, ordered by priority.
- **Structure**:
  > Rationale: Defines the required table format for PBIs, ensuring standardisation and ease of use.
  - **Table**: `| ID | Actor | User Story | Status | Conditions of Satisfaction (CoS) |`

## 3.3 Principles
1. The backlog is the single source of truth for all PBIs.
2. PBIs must be ordered by priority (highest at the top).

## 3.4 PBI Workflow

> Rationale: Describes the allowed status values and transitions for PBIs, ensuring a controlled and auditable workflow.

### 3.4.1 Status Definitions
- **status(Proposed)**: PBI has been suggested but not yet approved.
- **status(Agreed)**: PBI has been approved and is ready for implementation.
- **status(InProgress)**: PBI is being actively worked on.
- **status(InReview)**: PBI implementation is complete and awaiting review.
- **status(Done)**: PBI has been completed and accepted.
- **status(Rejected)**: PBI has been rejected and requires rework or deprioritization.

### 3.4.2 Event Transitions

  4. Log deprioritization in PBI history.
  5. Notify stakeholders of the change in priority.

### 3.4.3 Note

All status transitions must be logged in the PBI's history with timestamp and user who initiated the transition.

## 3.5 PBI History Log

> Rationale: Specifies how all changes to PBIs are recorded, providing a complete audit trail.

- **Location Description**: PBI change history is maintained in the backlog.md file.
- **Fields**:
  - **history_field(Timestamp)**: Date and time of the change (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS).
  - **history_field(PBI_ID)**: ID of the PBI that was changed.
  - **history_field(Event_Type)**: Type of event that occurred.
  - **history_field(Details)**: Description of the change.
  - **history_field(User)**: User who made the change.

## 3.6 PBI Detail Documents

> Rationale: Provides a dedicated space for detailed requirements, technical design, and UX considerations for each PBI, ensuring comprehensive documentation and alignment across the team.

- **Location Pattern**: `docs/delivery/<PBI-ID>/prd.md`
- **Purpose**: 
  - Serve as a mini-PRD for the PBI
  - Document the problem space and solution approach
  - Provide technical and UX details beyond what's in the backlog
  - Maintain a single source of truth for all PBI-related information
- **Required Sections**:

  - `## Related Tasks`
- **Linking**:
  - Must link back to the main backlog entry: `[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-<PBI-ID>)`
  - The backlog entry must link to this document: `[View Details](./<PBI-ID>/prd.md)`
- **Ownership**:
  - Created when a PBI moves from "Proposed" to "Agreed"
  - Maintained by the team member implementing the PBI
  - Reviewed during PBI review process
  - 
# 4. Task Management

> Rationale: Defines how tasks are documented, executed, and tracked, ensuring that all work is broken down into manageable, auditable units.

## 4.1 Task Documentation

> Rationale: Specifies the structure and content required for task documentation, supporting transparency and reproducibility.

- **Location Pattern**: docs/delivery/<PBI-ID>/
- **File Naming**: 
  - Task list: `tasks.md`
  - Task details: `<PBI-ID>-<TASK-ID>.md` (e.g., `1-1.md` for first task of PBI 1)
- **Required Sections**:
  > Rationale: Required sections ensure all tasks are fully described and verifiable
  - `# [Task-ID] [Task-Name]`
  - `## Description`
  - `## Status History`
  - `## Requirements`
  - `## Implementation Plan`
  - `## Verification`
  - `## Files Modified`

## 4.2 Principles
1. Each task must have its own dedicated markdown file.
2. Task files must follow the specified naming convention.
3. All required sections must be present and properly filled out.
4. When adding a task to the tasks index, its markdown file MUST be created immediately and linked using the pattern `[description](./<PBI-ID>-<TASK-ID>.md)`.
5. Individual task files must link back to the tasks index using the pattern `[Back to task list](../<tasks-index-file>.md)`.

## 4.3 Task Workflow

> Rationale: Describes the allowed status values and transitions for tasks, ensuring a controlled and auditable workflow.

## 4.4 Task Status Synchronisation

To maintain consistency across the codebase:

1. **Immediate Updates**: When a task's status changes, update both the task file and the tasks index (1-tasks.md) in the same commit.
2. **Status History**: Always add an entry to the task's status history when changing status.
3. **Status Verification**: Before starting work on a task, verify its status in both locations.
4. **Status Mismatch**: If a status mismatch is found, immediately update both locations to the most recent status.

Example of a status update in a task file:
```
| 2025-05-19 15:02:00 | Created       | N/A      | Proposed  | Task file created | Julian |
| 2025-05-19 16:15:00 | Status Update | Proposed | InProgress | Started work      | Julian |
```

Example of the corresponding update in 1-tasks.md:
```
| 1-7 | [Add pino logging...](./1-7.md) | InProgress | Pino logs connection... |
```

## 4.5 Status Definitions
- **task_status(Proposed)**: The initial state of a newly defined task.
- **task_status(Agreed)**: The User has approved the task description and its place in the priority list.
- **task_status(InProgress)**: The AI Agent is actively working on this task.
- **task_status(Review)**: The AI Agent has completed the work and it awaits User validation.
- **task_status(Done)**: The User has reviewed and approved the task's implementation.
- **task_status(Blocked)**: The task cannot proceed due to an external dependency or issue.

## 4.6 Event Transitions
- **event_transition on "user_approves" from Proposed to Agreed**:
  1. Verify task description is clear and complete.
  2. Ensure task is properly prioritized in the backlog.
  3. Create task documentation file following the _template.md pattern and link it in the tasks index.
   - The file must be named `<PBI-ID>-<TASK-ID>.md`
   - The task description in the index must link to this file
   - Analysis and design work must be undertaken and documented in the required sections of task file    
  4. Log status change in task history.

- **event_transition on "start_work" from Agreed to InProgress**:
  1. Verify no other tasks are InProgress for the same PBI.
  2. Create a new branch for the task if using version control.
  3. Log start time and assignee in task history.
  4. Update task documentation with implementation start details.

- **event_transition on "submit_for_review" from InProgress to Review**:
  1. Ensure all task requirements are met.
  2. Run all relevant tests and ensure they pass.
  3. Update task documentation with implementation details.
  4. Create a pull request or mark as ready for review.
  5. Notify the User that review is needed.
  6. Log submission for review in task history.

- **event_transition on "approve" from Review to Done**:
  1. Verify all acceptance criteria are met.
  2. Merge changes to the main branch if applicable.
  3. Update task documentation with completion details.
  4. Update task status and log completion time.
  5. Archive task documentation as needed.
  6. Notify relevant stakeholders of completion.
  7. Log approval in task history.
  8. **Review Next Task Relevance**: Before marking as Done, review the next task(s) in the PBI task list in light of the current task's implementation outcomes. Confirm with the User whether subsequent tasks remain relevant, need modification, or have become redundant due to implementation decisions or scope changes in the current task. Document any task modifications or removals in the task history.

- **event_transition on "reject" from Review to InProgress**:
  1. Document the reason for rejection in task history.
  2. Update task documentation with review feedback.
  3. Notify the AI Agent of required changes.
  4. Update task status and log the rejection.
  5. Create new tasks if additional work is identified.

- **event_transition on "significant_update" from Review to InProgress**:
  1. Document the nature of significant changes made to task requirements, implementation plan, or test plan.
  2. Update task status to reflect that additional work is now required.
  3. Log the update reason in task history.
  4. Notify stakeholders that the task requires additional implementation work.
  5. Resume development work to address the updated requirements.

- **event_transition on "mark_blocked" from InProgress to Blocked**:
  1. Document the reason for blocking in task history.
  2. Identify any dependencies or issues causing the block.
  3. Update task documentation with blocking details.
  4. Notify relevant stakeholders of the block.
  5. Consider creating new tasks to address blockers if needed.

- **event_transition on "unblock" from Blocked to InProgress**:
  1. Document the resolution of the blocking issue in task history.
  2. Update task documentation with resolution details.
  3. Resume work on the task.
  4. Notify relevant stakeholders that work has resumed.

## 4.7 One In Progress Task Limit

Only one task per PBI should be 'InProgress' at any given time to maintain focus and clarity. In special cases, the User may approve additional concurrent tasks.

## 4.8 Task History Log

> Rationale: Specifies how all changes to tasks are recorded, providing a complete audit trail.

- **Location Description**: Task change history is maintained in the task's markdown file under the 'Status History' section.
- **Required Fields**:
  > Rationale: Defines the required fields for logging task history, ensuring all relevant information is captured.
  - **history_field(Timestamp)**: Date and time of the change (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).
  - **history_field(Event_Type)**: Type of event that occurred.
  - **history_field(From_Status)**: Previous status of the task.
  - **history_field(To_Status)**: New status of the task.
  - **history_field(Details)**: Description of the change or action taken.
  - **history_field(User)**: User who initiated the change.

### 4.8.1 Format Example

```
| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-05-16 15:30:00 | Status Change | Proposed | Agreed | Task approved by Product Owner | johndoe |
| 2025-05-16 16:45:00 | Status Change | Agreed | InProgress | Started implementation | ai-agent-1 |
```

### 4.8.2 Task Validation Rules

> Rationale: Ensures all tasks adhere to required standards and workflows.

1. **Core Rules**:
   - All tasks must be associated with an existing PBI
   - Task IDs must be unique within their parent PBI
   - Tasks must follow the defined workflow states and transitions
   - All required documentation must be completed before marking a task as 'Done'
   - Task history must be maintained for all status changes
   - Only one task per PBI may be 'InProgress' at any time, unless explicitly approved
   - Every task in the tasks index MUST have a corresponding markdown file
   - Task descriptions in the index MUST be linked to their markdown files

2. **Pre-Implementation Checks**:
   - Verify the task exists and is in the correct status before starting work
   - Document the task ID in all related changes
   - List all files that will be modified
   - Get explicit approval before proceeding with implementation

3. **Error Prevention**:
   - If unable to access required files, stop and report the issue
   - For protected files, provide changes in a format that can be manually applied
   - Verify task status in both task file and index before starting work
   - Document all status checks in the task history

4. **Change Management**:
   - Reference the task ID in all commit messages
   - Update task status according to workflow
   - Ensure all changes are properly linked to the task
   - Document any deviations from the planned implementation

### 4.9 Version Control for Task Completion

> Rationale: Ensures consistent version control practices when completing tasks, maintaining traceability and automation.

1. **Commit Message Format**:
   - When a task moves from `Review` to `Done`, create a commit with the message:
     ```
     <task_id> <task_description>
     ```
   - Example: `1-7 Add pino logging to help debug database connection issues`

2. **Pull Request**:
   - Title: `[<task_id>] <task_description>`
   - Include a link to the task in the description
   - Ensure all task requirements are met before marking as `Done`

3. **Automation**:
   - When a task is marked as `Done`, run:
     ```bash
     git acp "<task_id> <task_description>"
     ```
   - This command should:
     1. Stage all changes
     2. Create a commit with the specified message
     3. Push to the remote branch

4. **Verification**:
   - Ensure the commit appears in the task's history
   - Confirm the task status is updated in both the task file and index
   - Verify the commit message follows the required format

## 4.10 Task Index File

> Rationale: Defines the standard structure for PBI-specific task index files, ensuring a consistent overview of tasks related to a Product Backlog Item.

*   **Location Pattern**: `docs/delivery/<PBI-ID>/tasks.md`
    *   Example: `docs/delivery/6/tasks.md`
*   **Purpose**: To list all tasks associated with a specific PBI, provide a brief description for each, show their current status, and link to their detailed task files.
*   **Required Sections and Content**:
    1.  **Title**:
        *   Format: `# Tasks for PBI <PBI-ID>: <PBI Title>`
        *   Example: `# Tasks for PBI 6: Ensure enrichment tasks are resilient to service and web page disruption`
    2.  **Introduction Line**:
        *   Format: `This document lists all tasks associated with PBI <PBI-ID>.`
    3.  **Link to Parent PBI**:
        *   Format: `**Parent PBI**: [PBI <PBI-ID>: <PBI Title>](./prd.md)`
        *   Example: `**Parent PBI**: [PBI 6: Ensure enrichment tasks are resilient to service and web page disruption](./prd.md)`
    4.  **Task Summary Section Header**:
        *   Format: `## Task Summary`
    5.  **Task Summary Table**:
        *   Columns: `| Task ID | Name | Status | Description |`
        *   Markdown Table Structure:
            ```markdown
            | Task ID | Name                                     | Status   | Description                        |
            | :------ | :--------------------------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------- |
            | <ID>    | [<Task Name>](./<PBI-ID>-<TaskNum>.md) | Proposed | <Brief task description>           |
            ```
        *   **`Task ID`**: The unique identifier for the task within the PBI (e.g., `6-1`).
        *   **`Name`**: The full name of the task, formatted as a Markdown link to its individual task file (e.g., `[Define and implement core Circuit Breaker state machine](./6-1.md)`).
        *   **`Status`**: The current status of the task, which must be one of the permitted values defined in Section 4.5 (Status Definitions).
        *   **`Description`**: A brief, one-sentence description of the task's objective.
*   **Prohibited Content**:
    *   The Task Summary table in this file must only contain what is specified, and nothing else, unless a User specifically oks it.
  
# 5. Testing Strategy and Documentation

> Rationale: Ensures that testing is approached thoughtfully, appropriately scoped, and well-documented, leading to higher quality software and maintainable test suites.

## 5.1 General Principles for Testing

1.  **Risk-Based Approach**: Prioritize testing efforts based on the complexity and risk associated with the features being developed.
2.  **Test Pyramid Adherence**: Strive for a healthy balance of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. While unit tests form the base, integration tests are crucial for verifying interactions between components.
3.  **Clarity and Maintainability**: Tests should be clear, concise, and easy to understand and maintain. Avoid overly complex test logic.
4.  **Automation**: Automate tests wherever feasible to ensure consistent and repeatable verification.

## 5.2 Test Scoping Guidelines

1.  **Unit Tests**:
    *   **Focus**: Test individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation from the code base. Specifically do not test package API methods directly they should be covered by the package tests themselves.
    *   **Mocking**: Mock all external dependencies of the unit under test.
    *   **Scope**: Verify the logic within the unit, including edge cases and error handling specific to that unit.

2.  **Integration Tests**:
    *   **Focus**: Verify the interaction and correct functioning of multiple components or services working together as a subsystem.
    *   **Example**: Testing a feature that involves an API endpoint, a service layer, database interaction, and a job queue.
    *   **Mocking Strategy**:
        *   Mock external, third-party services at the boundary of your application (e.g., external APIs like Firecrawl, Gemini).
        *   For internal infrastructure components (e.g., database, message queues like pg-boss), prefer using real instances configured for a test environment rather than deep mocking of their client libraries. This ensures tests are validating against actual behavior.
    *   **Starting Point for Complex Features**: For features involving significant component interaction, consider starting with integration tests to ensure the overall flow and orchestration are correct before (or in parallel with) writing more granular unit tests for individual components.

3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**:
    *   **Focus**: Test the entire application flow from the user's perspective, typically through the UI.
    *   **Scope**: Reserved for critical user paths and workflows.

## 5.3 Test Plan Documentation and Strategy

1.  **PBI-Level Testing Strategy**:
    *   The Conditions of Satisfaction (CoS) listed in a PBI detail document (`docs/delivery/<PBI-ID>/prd.md`) inherently define the high-level success criteria and scope of testing for the PBI. Detailed, exhaustive test plans are generally not duplicated at this PBI level if covered by tasks.
    *   The task list for a PBI (e.g., `docs/delivery/<PBI-ID>/tasks.md`) **must** include a dedicated task, typically named "E2E CoS Test" or similar (e.g., `<PBI-ID>-E2E-CoS-Test.md`).
    *   This "E2E CoS Test" task is responsible for holistic end-to-end testing that verifies the PBI's overall CoS are met. This task's document will contain the detailed E2E test plan, encompassing functionality that may span multiple individual implementation tasks within that PBI.

2.  **Task-Level Test Plan Proportionality**:
    *   **Pragmatic Principle**: Test plans must be proportional to the complexity and risk of the task. Avoid over-engineering test plans for simple tasks.
    *   **Simple Tasks** (constants, interfaces, configuration):
        *   Test plan should focus on compilation and basic integration
        *   Example: "TypeScript compilation passes without errors"
    *   **Basic Implementation Tasks** (simple functions, basic integrations):
        *   Test plan should verify core functionality and error handling patterns
        *   Example: "Function can be registered with system, basic workflow works, follows existing error patterns"
    *   **Complex Implementation Tasks** (multi-service integration, complex business logic):
        *   More detailed test plans with specific scenarios and edge cases
        *   Should still avoid excessive elaboration unless truly warranted by risk

3.  **Test Plan Documentation Requirements**:
    *   **Requirement**: Every individual task that involves code implementation or modification **must** include a test plan, but the detail level should match the task complexity.
    *   **Location**: The test plan must be documented within a "## Test Plan" section of the task's detail document.
    *   **Content for Simple Tasks**:
        *   Success criteria focused on basic functionality and compilation
        *   No elaborate scenarios unless complexity warrants it
    *   **Content for Complex Tasks**:
        *   **Objective(s)**: What the tests for this specific task aim to verify
        *   **Test Scope**: Specific components, functions, or interactions covered
        *   **Environment & Setup**: Relevant test environment details or setup steps
        *   **Mocking Strategy**: Definition of mocks used for the task's tests
        *   **Key Test Scenarios**: Scenarios covering successful paths, expected failure paths, and edge cases *relevant to the task's scope*
        *   **Success Criteria**: How test success/failure is determined for the task
    *   **Review**: Task-level test plans should be reviewed for appropriateness to task complexity
    *   **Living Document**: Test plans should be updated if task requirements change significantly
    *   **Task Completion Prerequisite**: A task cannot be marked as "Done" unless the tests defined in its test plan are passing

4.  **Test Distribution Strategy**:
    *   **Avoid Test Plan Duplication**: Detailed edge case testing and complex scenarios should be concentrated in dedicated E2E testing tasks rather than repeated across individual implementation tasks
    *   **Focus Individual Tasks**: Individual implementation tasks should focus on verifying their specific functionality works as intended within the broader system
    *   **Comprehensive Testing**: Complex integration testing, error scenarios, and full workflow validation belongs in dedicated testing tasks (typically E2E CoS tests)

## 5.4 Test Implementation Guidelines

1.  **Test File Location**:
    *   **Unit Tests**: Located in `test/unit/` mirroring the source directory structure.
    *   **Integration Tests**: Located in `test/integration/` (or `test/<module>/` e.g., `test/server/` as per existing conventions if more appropriate), reflecting the module or subsystem being tested.
2.  **Test Naming**: Test files and descriptions should be named clearly and descriptively.
