	Abstract = {In Drosophila, multiple lines of evidence converge in suggesting that beneficial substitutions to the genome may be common. All suffer from confounding factors, however, such that the interpretation of the evidence-in particular, conclusions about the rate and strength of beneficial substitutions-remains tentative. Here, we use genome-wide polymorphism data in D. simulans and sequenced genomes of its close relatives to construct a readily interpretable characterization of the effects of positive selection: the shape of average neutral diversity around amino acid substitutions. As expected under recurrent selective sweeps, we find a trough in diversity levels around amino acid but not around synonymous substitutions, a distinctive pattern that is not expected under alternative models. This characterization is richer than previous approaches, which relied on limited summaries of the data (e.g., the slope of a scatter plot), and relates to underlying selection parameters in a straightforward way, allowing us to make more reliable inferences about the prevalence and strength of adaptation. Specifically, we develop a coalescent-based model for the shape of the entire curve and use it to infer adaptive parameters by maximum likelihood. Our inference suggests that ∼13% of amino acid substitutions cause selective sweeps. Interestingly, it reveals two classes of beneficial fixations: a minority (approximately 3%) that appears to have had large selective effects and accounts for most of the reduction in diversity, and the remaining 10%, which seem to have had very weak selective effects. These estimates therefore help to reconcile the apparent conflict among previously published estimates of the strength of selection. More generally, our findings provide unequivocal evidence for strongly beneficial substitutions in Drosophila and illustrate how the rapidly accumulating genome-wide data can be leveraged to address enduring questions about the genetic basis of adaptation.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Our understanding of gene regulation is currently limited by our ability to collectively synthesize and catalogue transcriptional regulatory elements stored in scientific literature. Over the past decade, this task has become increasingly challenging as the accrual of biologically validated regulatory sequences has accelerated. To meet this challenge, novel community-based approaches to regulatory element annotation are required.
SUMMARY: Here, we present the Open Regulatory Annotation (ORegAnno) database as a dynamic collection of literature-curated regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and regulatory mutations (polymorphisms and haplotypes). ORegAnno has been designed to manage the submission, indexing and validation of new annotations from users worldwide. Submissions to ORegAnno are immediately cross-referenced to EnsEMBL, dbSNP, Entrez Gene, the NCBI Taxonomy database and PubMed, where appropriate.
AVAILABILITY: ORegAnno is available directly through MySQL, Web services, and online at http://www.oreganno.org. All software is licensed under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL).},

	Abstract = {The GENCODE Consortium aims to identify all gene features in the human genome using a combination of computational analysis, manual annotation, and experimental validation. Since the first public release of this annotation data set, few new protein-coding loci have been added, yet the number of alternative splicing transcripts annotated has steadily increased. The GENCODE 7 release contains 20,687 protein-coding and 9640 long noncoding RNA loci and has 33,977 coding transcripts not represented in UCSC genes and RefSeq. It also has the most comprehensive annotation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form consisting of two exons. We have examined the completeness of the transcript annotation and found that 35% of transcriptional start sites are supported by CAGE clusters and 62% of protein-coding genes have annotated polyA sites. Over one-third of GENCODE protein-coding genes are supported by peptide hits derived from mass spectrometry spectra submitted to Peptide Atlas. New models derived from the Illumina Body Map 2.0 RNA-seq data identify 3689 new loci not currently in GENCODE, of which 3127 consist of two exon models indicating that they are possibly unannotated long noncoding loci. GENCODE 7 is publicly available from gencodegenes.org and via the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browsers.},

By analyzing polymorphisms in the admixed individual against those seen in representatives from the populations, we can infer the ancestral source of the individual's haploblocks. In this paper we describe a novel approach for ancestry inference, HAPAA (HMM-based analysis of polymorphisms in admixed ancestries), that models the allelic and haplotypic variation in the populations and captures the signal of correlation due to linkage disequilibrium, resulting in greatly improved accuracy. We also introduce a methodology for evaluating the effect of genetic divergence between ancestral populations and time-to-admixture on inference accuracy. Using HAPAA, we explore the limits of ancestry inference in closely related populations.},

	Abstract = {Our understanding of the role played by neurotransmitter receptors in the developing brain has advanced in recent years. The major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain, glutamate and GABA, activate both ionotropic (ligand-gated ion channels) and metabotropic (G protein-coupled) receptors, and are generally associated with neuronal communication in the mature brain. However, before the emergence of their role in neurotransmission in adulthood, they also act to influence earlier developmental events, some of which occur prior to synapse formation: such as proliferation, migration, differentiation or survival processes during neural development. To fulfill these actions in the constructing of the nervous system, different types of glutamate and GABA receptors need to be expressed both at the right time and at the right place. The identification by molecular cloning of 16 ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits, eight metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes, 21 ionotropic and two metabotropic GABA receptor subunits, some of which exist in alternatively splice variants, has enriched our appreciation of how molecular diversity leads to functional diversity in the brain. It now appears that many different types of glutamate and GABA receptor subunits have prominent expression in the embryonic and/or postnatal brain, whereas others are mainly present in the adult brain. Although the significance of this differential expression of subunits is not fully understood, it appears that the change in subunit composition is essential for normal development in particular brain regions. This review focuses on emerging information relating to the expression and role of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmitter receptors during prenatal and postnatal development.},

	Abstract = {Over the course of ontogenesis, the human brain and human cognitive abilities develop in parallel, resulting in a phenotype strikingly distinct from that of other primates. Here, we used microarrays and RNA-sequencing to examine human-specific gene expression changes taking place during postnatal brain development in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. We show that the most prominent human-specific expression change affects genes associated with synaptic functions and represents an extreme shift in the timing of synaptic development in the prefrontal cortex, but not the cerebellum. Consequently, peak expression of synaptic genes in the prefrontal cortex is shifted from <1 yr in chimpanzees and macaques to 5 yr in humans. This result was supported by protein expression profiles of synaptic density markers and by direct observation of synaptic density by electron microscopy. Mechanistically, the human-specific change in timing of synaptic development involves the MEF2A-mediated activity-dependent regulatory pathway. Evolutionarily, this change may have taken place after the split of the human and the Neanderthal lineages.},

	Abstract = {Non-coding DNA comprises approximately 80% of the euchromatic portion of the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Non-coding sequences are known to contain functionally important elements controlling gene expression, but the proportion of sites that are selectively constrained is still largely unknown. We have compared the complete D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans genome sequences to estimate mean selective constraint (the fraction of mutations that are eliminated by selection) in coding and non-coding DNA by standardizing to substitution rates in putatively unconstrained sequences. We show that constraint is positively correlated with intronic and intergenic sequence length and is generally remarkably strong in non-coding DNA, implying that more than half of all point mutations in the Drosophila genome are deleterious. This fraction is also likely to be an underestimate if many substitutions in non-coding DNA are adaptively driven to fixation. We also show that substitutions in long introns and intergenic sequences are clustered, such that there is an excess of substitutions <8 bp apart and a deficit farther apart. These results suggest that there are blocks of constrained nucleotides, presumably involved in gene expression control, that are concentrated in long non-coding sequences. Furthermore, we infer that there is more than three times as much functional non-coding DNA as protein-coding DNA in the Drosophila genome. Most deleterious mutations therefore occur in non-coding DNA, and these may make an important contribution to a wide variety of evolutionary processes.},

	Abstract = {Here, we describe the construction of a phylogenetically deep, whole-genome alignment of 20 flowering plants, along with an analysis of plant genome conservation. Each included angiosperm genome was aligned to a reference genome, Arabidopsis thaliana, using the LASTZ/MULTIZ paradigm and tools from the University of California-Santa Cruz Genome Browser source code. In addition to the multiple alignment, we created a local genome browser displaying multiple tracks of newly generated genome annotation, as well as annotation sourced from published data of other research groups. An investigation into A. thaliana gene features present in the aligned A. lyrata genome revealed better conservation of start codons, stop codons, and splice sites within our alignments (51% of features from A. thaliana conserved without interruption in A. lyrata) when compared with previous publicly available plant pairwise alignments (34% of features conserved). The detailed view of conservation across angiosperms revealed not only high coding-sequence conservation but also a large set of previously uncharacterized intergenic conservation. From this, we annotated the collection of conserved features, revealing dozens of putative noncoding RNAs, including some with recorded small RNA expression. Comparing conservation between kingdoms revealed a faster decay of vertebrate genome features when compared with angiosperm genomes. Finally, conserved sequences were searched for folding RNA features, including but not limited to noncoding RNA (ncRNA) genes. Among these, we highlight a double hairpin in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the PRIN2 gene and a putative ncRNA with homology targeting the LAF3 protein.},

Currently (v43, August 2009), COSMIC contains details of 1.5-million experiments performed through 13,423 genes in almost 370,000 tumours, describing over 90,000 individual mutations. Data are gathered from two sources, publications in the scientific literature, (v43 contains 7797 curated articles) and the full output of the genome-wide screens from the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) at the Sanger Institute, UK. Most of the world's literature on point mutations in human cancer has now been curated into COSMIC and while this is continually updated, a greater emphasis on curating fusion gene mutations is driving the expansion of this information; over 2700 fusion gene mutations are now described. Whole-genome sequencing screens are now identifying large numbers of genomic rearrangements in cancer and COSMIC is now displaying details of these analyses also. Examination of COSMIC's data is primarily web-driven, focused on providing mutation range and frequency statistics based upon a choice of gene and/or cancer phenotype. Graphical views provide easily interpretable summaries of large quantities of data, and export functions can provide precise details of user-selected data.},

	Abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster has played a pivotal role in the development of modern population genetics. However, many basic questions regarding the demographic and adaptive history of this species remain unresolved. We report the genome sequencing of 139 wild-derived strains of D. melanogaster, representing 22 population samples from the sub-Saharan ancestral range of this species, along with one European population. Most genomes were sequenced above 25X depth from haploid embryos. Results indicated a pervasive influence of non-African admixture in many African populations, motivating the development and application of a novel admixture detection method. Admixture proportions varied among populations, with greater admixture in urban locations. Admixture levels also varied across the genome, with localized peaks and valleys suggestive of a non-neutral introgression process. Genomes from the same location differed starkly in ancestry, suggesting that isolation mechanisms may exist within African populations. After removing putatively admixed genomic segments, the greatest genetic diversity was observed in southern Africa (e.g. Zambia), while diversity in other populations was largely consistent with a geographic expansion from this potentially ancestral region. The European population showed different levels of diversity reduction on each chromosome arm, and some African populations displayed chromosome arm-specific diversity reductions. Inversions in the European sample were associated with strong elevations in diversity across chromosome arms. Genomic scans were conducted to identify loci that may represent targets of positive selection within an African population, between African populations, and between European and African populations. A disproportionate number of candidate selective sweep regions were located near genes with varied roles in gene regulation. Outliers for Europe-Africa F(ST) were found to be enriched in genomic regions of locally elevated cosmopolitan admixture, possibly reflecting a role for some of these loci in driving the introgression of non-African alleles into African populations.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of human anatomical features likely involved changes in gene regulation during development. However, the nature and extent of human-specific developmental regulatory functions remain unknown. We obtained a genome-wide view of cis-regulatory evolution in human embryonic tissues by comparing the histone modification H3K27ac, which provides a quantitative readout of promoter and enhancer activity, during human, rhesus, and mouse limb development. Based on increased H3K27ac, we find that 13% of promoters and 11% of enhancers have gained activity on the human lineage since the human-rhesus divergence. These gains largely arose by modification of ancestral regulatory activities in the limb or potential co-option from other tissues and are likely to have heterogeneous genetic causes. Most enhancers that exhibit gain of activity in humans originated in mammals. Gains at promoters and enhancers in the human limb are associated with increased gene expression, suggesting they include molecular drivers of human morphological evolution.},

@article{Walldorf:1992pi,
	Abstract = {The empty spiracles (ems) gene of Drosophila melanogaster is necessary for proper head formation and the development of the posterior spiracles. We have isolated a homeobox-containing gene, W13, by cross-homology using the Drosophila muscle segment homeobox gene (msh) as a probe. The W13 gene maps at 88A, where the ems locus has been previously localized genetically. The sequence alterations found in the W13 coding region from two mutant ems alleles show that W13 is the ems gene. A 2.4 kb RNA corresponding to the ems transcript is expressed from cellular blastoderm throughout all embryonic and larval stages. In situ hybridization to whole mount embryos reveals two domains of expression. During the cellular blastoderm stage ems is expressed in the developing head in a single anterior band. This is correlated with its possible function as an anterior gap gene that is expressed in the preantennal, antennal and intercalary segments and is required for the development of the antennal sense organ, the optic lobe and parts of the head skeleton. The early expression of the ems gene is controlled by the anterior morphogen bicoid (bcd). Using a gene fusion we identified a cis-acting element which is a target for the bcd gene product. Later during embryogenesis ems is expressed in lateral regions of each segment, where the tracheal pits form and lateral neuroblasts originate, as well as in the posterior spiracles. This late expression partially correlates with defects seen in the tracheal tree of ems embryos. In addition to a homeodomain, the N-terminal portion of the predicted protein sequence is very proline-rich, whereas the C-terminus has an acidic profile consistent with the role of the ems gene product as a transcription factor.},

To define roles for the homeodomain transcription factor EMX2, we engineered nestin-Emx2 transgenic mice that overexpress Emx2 in cortical progenitors coincident with expression of endogenous Emx2 and survive postnatally. Cortical size, lamination, thalamus, and thalamocortical pathfinding are normal in homozygous nestin-Emx2 mice. However, primary sensory and motor areas are disproportionately altered in size and shift rostrolaterally. Heterozygous transgenics have similar but smaller changes. Opposite changes are found in heterozygous Emx2 knockout mice. Fgf8 expression in the commissural plate of nestin-Emx2 mice is indistinguishable from wild-type, but Pax6 expression is downregulated in rostral cortical progenitors, suggesting that EMX2 repression of PAX6 specification of rostral identities contributes to reduced rostral areas. We conclude that EMX2 levels in cortical progenitors disproportionately specify sizes and positions of primary cortical areas.},

	Abstract = {Humans differ from other animals in many aspects of anatomy, physiology, and behaviour; however, the genotypic basis of most human-specific traits remains unknown. Recent whole-genome comparisons have made it possible to identify genes with elevated rates of amino acid change or divergent expression in humans, and non-coding sequences with accelerated base pair changes. Regulatory alterations may be particularly likely to produce phenotypic effects while preserving viability, and are known to underlie interesting evolutionary differences in other species. Here we identify molecular events particularly likely to produce significant regulatory changes in humans: complete deletion of sequences otherwise highly conserved between chimpanzees and other mammals. We confirm 510 such deletions in humans, which fall almost exclusively in non-coding regions and are enriched near genes involved in steroid hormone signalling and neural function. One deletion removes a sensory vibrissae and penile spine enhancer from the human androgen receptor (AR) gene, a molecular change correlated with anatomical loss of androgen-dependent sensory vibrissae and penile spines in the human lineage. Another deletion removes a forebrain subventricular zone enhancer near the tumour suppressor gene growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, gamma (GADD45G), a loss correlated with expansion of specific brain regions in humans. Deletions of tissue-specific enhancers may thus accompany both loss and gain traits in the human lineage, and provide specific examples of the kinds of regulatory alterations and inactivation events long proposed to have an important role in human evolutionary divergence.},

	Abstract = {We developed the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) to analyze the functional significance of cis-regulatory regions identified by localized measurements of DNA binding events across an entire genome. Whereas previous methods took into account only binding proximal to genes, GREAT is able to properly incorporate distal binding sites and control for false positives using a binomial test over the input genomic regions. GREAT incorporates annotations from 20 ontologies and is available as a web application. Applying GREAT to data sets from chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) of multiple transcription-associated factors, including SRF, NRSF, GABP, Stat3 and p300 in different developmental contexts, we recover many functions of these factors that are missed by existing gene-based tools, and we generate testable hypotheses. The utility of GREAT is not limited to ChIP-seq, as it could also be applied to open chromatin, localized epigenomic markers and similar functional data sets, as well as comparative genomics sets.},

In humans, >60% of these are pseudogenes. In contrast, the mouse OR repertoire, although of roughly equal size, contains only approximately 20% pseudogenes. We asked whether the high fraction of nonfunctional OR genes is specific to humans or is a common feature of all primates. To this end, we have compared the sequences of 50 human OR coding regions, regardless of their functional annotations, to those of their putative orthologs in chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and rhesus macaques. We found that humans have accumulated mutations that disrupt OR coding regions roughly 4-fold faster than any other species sampled. As a consequence, the fraction of OR pseudogenes in humans is almost twice as high as in the non-human primates, suggesting a human-specific process of OR gene disruption, likely due to a reduced chemosensory dependence relative to apes.},

	Abstract = {We report a comprehensive comparative analysis of human and mouse olfactory receptor (OR) genes. The OR family is the largest mammalian gene family known. We identify approximately 93% of an estimated 1500 mouse ORs, exceeding previous estimates and the number of human ORs by 50%. Only 20% are pseudogenes, giving a functional OR repertoire in mice that is three times larger than that of human. The proteins encoded by intact human ORs are less highly conserved than those of mouse, in patterns that suggest that even some apparently intact human OR genes may encode non-functional proteins. Mouse ORs are clustered in 46 genomic locations, compared to a much more dispersed pattern in human. We find orthologous clusters at syntenic human locations for most mouse genes, indicating that most OR gene clusters predate primate-rodent divergence. However, many recent local OR duplications in both genomes obscure one-to-one orthologous relationships, thereby complicating cross-species inferences about OR-ligand interactions. Local duplications are the major force shaping the gene family. Recent interchromosomal duplications of ORs have also occurred, but much more frequently in human than in mouse. In addition to clarifying the evolutionary forces shaping this gene family, our study provides the basis for functional studies of the transcriptional regulation and ligand-binding capabilities of the OR gene family.},

	Abstract = {N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) is abundantly expressed in most mammals, but it is not detectable in humans. The expression of NeuGc is controlled by cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NeuAc) hydroxylase activity. We previously cloned a cDNA for mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase and found that the human genome contains a homologue. We report here the molecular basis for the absence of NeuGc in humans. We cloned a cDNA for human CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase from a HeLa cell cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a 486-amino acid protein, and its deduced amino acid sequence lacks a domain corresponding to the N-terminal 104 amino acids of the mouse CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase protein, although the human protein is highly identical (93%) to the rest of the mouse hydroxylase protein. The N-terminal truncation of the human hydroxylase is caused by deletion of a 92-base pair-long exon in human genomic DNA. The human hydroxylase expressed in COS-7 cells exhibited no enzymatic activity, and a mouse hydroxylase mutant, which lacks the N-terminal domain, was also inactive. A chimera composed of the human hydroxylase and the N-terminal domain of the mouse hydroxylase displayed the enzyme activity. These results indicate that the human homologue of CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase is inactive because it lacks an N-terminal domain that is essential for enzyme activity. The absence of NeuGc in human glycoconjugates is due to a partial deletion in the gene that encodes CMP-NeuAc hydroxylase.},

	Abstract = {Sialic acids are important cell-surface molecules of animals in the deuterostome lineage. Although humans do not express easily detectable amounts of N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc, a hydroxylated form of the common sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac), it is a major component in great ape tissues, except in the brain. This difference correlates with lack of the hydroxylase activity that converts CMP-Neu5Ac to CMP-Neu5Gc. Here we report cloning of human and chimpanzee hydroxylase cDNAs. Although this chimpanzee cDNA is similar to the murine homologue, the human cDNA contains a 92-bp deletion resulting in a frameshift mutation. The isolated human gene also shows evidence for this deletion. Genomic PCR analysis indicates that this deletion does not occur in any of the African great apes. The gene is localized to 6p22-p23 in both humans and great apes, which does not correspond to known chromosomal rearrangements that occurred during hominoid evolution. Thus, the lineage leading to modern humans suffered a mutation sometime after the common ancestor with the chimpanzee and bonobo, potentially affecting recognition by a variety of endogenous and exogenous sialic acid-binding lectins. Also, the expression of Neu5Gc previously reported in human fetuses and tumors as well as the traces detected in some normal adult humans must be mediated by an alternate pathway.},

	Abstract = {Caspase 12 has been cloned from rodent cells, in which it mediated apoptosis in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Based on experiments with murine cells it was suggested that this caspase plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. By alignment of the murine caspase 12 cDNA with the human genome sequence we localized the human caspase 12 gene at a single locus within the caspase 1/ICE gene cluster on chromosome 11q22.3. RT-PCR and molecular cloning revealed that nine alternatively spliced transcripts of this gene are expressed. A frame shift mutation and a premature stop codon which is present in all splice variants preclude the expression of a full length protein. An additional loss-of-function mutation within the SHG box, a critical site in caspases, prohibits any proteins, if they are produced, from acting catalytically. Based on our data we conclude that functional caspase 12 is lost in humans and that it can therefore not play a role in Alzheimer's disease.},

	Abstract = {Powerful masticatory muscles are found in most primates, including chimpanzees and gorillas, and were part of a prominent adaptation of Australopithecus and Paranthropus, extinct genera of the family Hominidae. In contrast, masticatory muscles are considerably smaller in both modern and fossil members of Homo. The evolving hominid masticatory apparatus--traceable to a Late Miocene, chimpanzee-like morphology--shifted towards a pattern of gracilization nearly simultaneously with accelerated encephalization in early Homo. Here, we show that the gene encoding the predominant myosin heavy chain (MYH) expressed in these muscles was inactivated by a frameshifting mutation after the lineages leading to humans and chimpanzees diverged. Loss of this protein isoform is associated with marked size reductions in individual muscle fibres and entire masticatory muscles. Using the coding sequence for the myosin rod domains as a molecular clock, we estimate that this mutation appeared approximately 2.4 million years ago, predating the appearance of modern human body size and emigration of Homo from Africa. This represents the first proteomic distinction between humans and chimpanzees that can be correlated with a traceable anatomic imprint in the fossil record.},

	Abstract = {Computational efforts to identify functional elements within genomes leverage comparative sequence information by looking for regions that exhibit evidence of selective constraint. One way of detecting constrained elements is to follow a bottom-up approach by computing constraint scores for individual positions of a multiple alignment and then defining constrained elements as segments of contiguous, highly scoring nucleotide positions. Here we present GERP++, a new tool that uses maximum likelihood evolutionary rate estimation for position-specific scoring and, in contrast to previous bottom-up methods, a novel dynamic programming approach to subsequently define constrained elements. GERP++ evaluates a richer set of candidate element breakpoints and ranks them based on statistical significance, eliminating the need for biased heuristic extension techniques. Using GERP++ we identify over 1.3 million constrained elements spanning over 7% of the human genome. We predict a higher fraction than earlier estimates largely due to the annotation of longer constrained elements, which improves one to one correspondence between predicted elements with known functional sequences. GERP++ is an efficient and effective tool to provide both nucleotide- and element-level constraint scores within deep multiple sequence alignments.},

	Abstract = {Meiotic recombinations contribute to genetic diversity by yielding new combinations of alleles. Recently, high-resolution recombination maps were inferred from high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns that capture historical recombination events. The use of these maps has been demonstrated by the identification of recombination hotspots and associated motifs, and the discovery that the PRDM9 gene affects the proportion of recombinations occurring at hotspots. However, these maps provide no information about individual or sex differences. Moreover, locus-specific demographic factors like natural selection can bias LD-based estimates of recombination rate. Existing genetic maps based on family data avoid these shortcomings, but their resolution is limited by relatively few meioses and a low density of markers. Here we used genome-wide SNP data from 15,257 parent-offspring pairs to construct the first recombination maps based on directly observed recombinations with a resolution that is effective down to 10 kilobases (kb). Comparing male and female maps reveals that about 15% of hotspots in one sex are specific to that sex. Although male recombinations result in more shuffling of exons within genes, female recombinations generate more new combinations of nearby genes. We discover novel associations between recombination characteristics of individuals and variants in the PRDM9 gene and we identify new recombination hotspots. Comparisons of our maps with two LD-based maps inferred from data of HapMap populations of Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU) and Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI) reveal population differences previously masked by noise and map differences at regions previously described as targets of natural selection.},

We use evolutionary signatures and comparisons with experimental data sets to suggest candidate functions for ∼60% of constrained bases. These elements reveal a small number of new coding exons, candidate stop codon readthrough events and over 10,000 regions of overlapping synonymous constraint within protein-coding exons. We find 220 candidate RNA structural families, and nearly a million elements overlapping potential promoter, enhancer and insulator regions. We report specific amino acid residues that have undergone positive selection, 280,000 non-coding elements exapted from mobile elements and more than 1,000 primate- and human-accelerated elements.

	Abstract = {Genetic adaptation to external stimuli occurs through the combined action of mutation and selection. A central problem in genetics is to identify loci responsive to specific selective constraints. Many tests have been proposed to identify the genomic signatures of natural selection by quantifying the skew in the site frequency spectrum (SFS) under selection relative to neutrality. We build upon recent work that connects many of these tests under a common framework, by describing how selective sweeps affect the scaled SFS. We show that the specific skew depends on many attributes of the sweep, including the selection coefficient and the time under selection. Using supervised learning on extensive simulated data, we characterize the features of the scaled SFS that best separate different types of selective sweeps from neutrality. We develop a test, SFselect, that consistently outperforms many existing tests over a wide range of selective sweeps. We apply SFselect to polymorphism data from a laboratory evolution experiment of Drosophila melanogaster adapted to hypoxia and identify loci that strengthen the role of the Notch pathway in hypoxia tolerance, but were missed by previous approaches. We further apply our test to human data and identify regions that are in agreement with earlier studies, as well as many novel regions.},

	Abstract = {The support vector machine (SVM) approach represents a data-driven method for solving classification tasks. It has been shown to produce lower prediction error compared to classifiers based on other methods like artificial neural networks, especially when large numbers of features are considered for sample description. In this review, the theory and main principles of the SVM approach are outlined, and successful applications in traditional areas of bioinformatics research are described. Current developments in techniques related to the SVM approach are reviewed which might become relevant for future functional genomics and chemogenomics projects. In a comparative study, we developed neural network and SVM models to identify small organic molecules that potentially modulate the function of G-protein coupled receptors. The SVM system was able to correctly classify approximately 90% of the compounds in a cross-validation study yielding a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.78. This classifier can be used for fast filtering of compound libraries in virtual screening applications.},

	Abstract = {Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) constitute the great majority of variations in the human genome, and as heritable variable landmarks they are useful markers for disease mapping and resolving population structure. Redundant coverage in overlaps of large-insert genomic clones, sequenced as part of the Human Genome Project, comprises a quarter of the genome, and it is representative in terms of base compositional and functional sequence features. We mined these regions to produce 500,000 high-confidence SNP candidates as a uniform resource for describing nucleotide diversity and its regional variation within the genome. Distributions of marker density observed at different overlap length scales under a model of recombination and population size change show that the history of the population represented by the public genome sequence is one of collapse followed by a recent phase of mild size recovery. The inferred times of collapse and recovery are Upper Paleolithic, in agreement with archaeological evidence of the initial modern human colonization of Europe.},

The proportion of mutations that are advantageous, effectively neutral and deleterious varies between species, and the DFE differs between coding and non-coding DNA. Despite these differences between species and genomic regions, some general principles have emerged: advantageous mutations are rare, and those that are strongly selected are exponentially distributed; and the DFE of deleterious mutations is complex and multi-modal.},

	Abstract = {Although only 5% of the human genome is conserved across mammals, a substantially larger portion is biochemically active, raising the question of whether the additional elements evolve neutrally or confer a lineage-specific fitness advantage. To address this question, we integrate human variation information from the 1000 Genomes Project and activity data from the ENCODE Project. A broad range of transcribed and regulatory nonconserved elements show decreased human diversity, suggesting lineage-specific purifying selection. Conversely, conserved elements lacking activity show increased human diversity, suggesting that some recently became nonfunctional. Regulatory elements under human constraint in nonconserved regions were found near color vision and nerve-growth genes, consistent with purifying selection for recently evolved functions. Our results suggest continued turnover in regulatory regions, with at least an additional 4% of the human genome subject to lineage-specific constraint.},

Here, we jointly analyze population genomic and comparative genomic data to search for functional processes showing relaxed negative selection specifically in the human lineage, whereas remaining evolutionarily conserved in other mammals. Consistent with previous studies, we find that olfactory receptor genes display such a signature of relaxation in humans. Intriguingly, proteasome genes also show a prominent signal of human-specific relaxation: multiple proteasome subunits, including four members of the catalytic core particle, contain high frequency nonsynonymous polymorphisms at sites conserved across mammals. Chimpanzee proteasome genes do not display a similar trend. Human proteasome genes also bear no evidence of recent positive or balancing selection. These results suggest human-specific relaxation of negative selection in proteasome subunits; the exact biological causes, however, remain unknown.},

@article{Pierron:2013pd,
	Abstract = {Knowledge and understanding about the selective pressures that have shaped present human genetic diversity have dramatically increased in the last few years in parallel with the availability of large genomic datasets. The release of large datasets composed of millions of SNPs across hundreds of genomes by HAPMAP, the Human Genome Diversity Panel, and other projects has led to considerable effort to detect selection signals across the nuclear genome (Coop et al., 2009; Lopez Herraez et al., 2009; Sabeti et al., 2006, 2007; Voight et al., 2006). Most of the research has focused on positive selection forces although other selective forces, such as negative selection, may have played a substantive role on the shape of our genome. Here we studied the selective strengths acting presently on the genome by making computational predictions of the pathogenicity of nonsynonymous protein mutations and interpreting the distribution of scores in terms of selection. We could show that the genetic diversity for all the major pathways is still constrained by negative selection in all 11 human populations studied. In a single exception, we observed a relaxation of negative selection acting on olfactory receptors. Since a decreased number of functioning olfactory receptors in human compared with other primates had already been shown, this suggests that the role of olfactory receptors for survival and reproductive success has decreased during human evolution. By showing that negative selection is still relaxed, the present results imply that no plateau of minimal function has yet been reached in modern humans and therefore that olfactory capability might still be decreasing. This is a first clue to present human evolution.},

Because they are genetically and physiologically similar to humans, rhesus monkeys are the most widely used nonhuman primate in basic and applied biomedical research. We determined the genome sequence of an Indian-origin Macaca mulatta female and compared the data with chimpanzees and humans to reveal the structure of ancestral primate genomes and to identify evidence for positive selection and lineage-specific expansions and contractions of gene families. A comparison of sequences from individual animals was used to investigate their underlying genetic diversity.

Through comparison with the human genome, we have generated a largely complete catalogue of the genetic differences that have accumulated since the human and chimpanzee species diverged from our common ancestor, constituting approximately thirty-five million single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion/deletion events, and various chromosomal rearrangements. We use this catalogue to explore the magnitude and regional variation of mutational forces shaping these two genomes, and the strength of positive and negative selection acting on their genes. In particular, we find that the patterns of evolution in human and chimpanzee protein-coding genes are highly correlated and dominated by the fixation of neutral and slightly deleterious alleles. We also use the chimpanzee genome as an outgroup to investigate human population genetics and identify signatures of selective sweeps in recent human evolution.},

Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98% of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1% in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.},

We developed a method, composite of multiple signals (CMS), that combines tests for multiple signals of selection and increases resolution by up to 100-fold. By applying CMS to candidate regions from the International Haplotype Map, we localized population-specific selective signals to 55 kilobases (median), identifying known and novel causal variants. CMS can not just identify individual loci but implicates precise variants selected by evolution.},

@article{Katzman:2010kx,
	Abstract = {Regions of the genome that have been the target of positive selection specifically along the human lineage are of special importance in human biology. We used high throughput sequencing combined with methods to enrich human genomic samples for particular targets to obtain the sequence of 22 chromosomal samples at high depth in 40 kb neighborhoods of 49 previously identified 100-400 bp elements that show evidence for human accelerated evolution. In addition to selection, the pattern of nucleotide substitutions in several of these elements suggested an historical bias favoring the conversion of weak (A or T) alleles into strong (G or C) alleles. Here we found strong evidence in the derived allele frequency spectra of many of these 40 kb regions for ongoing weak-to-strong fixation bias. Comparison of the nucleotide composition at polymorphic loci to the composition at sites of fixed substitutions additionally reveals the signature of historical weak-to-strong fixation bias in a subset of these regions. Most of the regions with evidence for historical bias do not also have signatures of ongoing bias, suggesting that the evolutionary forces generating weak-to-strong bias are not constant over time. To investigate the role of selection in shaping these regions, we analyzed the spatial pattern of polymorphism in our samples. We found no significant evidence for selective sweeps, possibly because the signal of such sweeps has decayed beyond the power of our tests to detect them. Together, these results do not rule out functional roles for the observed changes in these regions-indeed there is good evidence that the first two are functional elements in humans-but they suggest that a fixation process (such as biased gene conversion) that is biased at the nucleotide level, but is otherwise selectively neutral, could be an important evolutionary force at play in them, both historically and at present.},

@article{Kolaczkowski:2010uq,
	Abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is quickly emerging as a vital component of genome organization, gene regulation and immunity in Drosophila and other species. Previous studies have suggested that, as a whole, genes involved in RNAi are under intense positive selection in D. melanogaster. Here we characterize the extent and patterns of adaptive evolution in 23 known Drosophila RNAi genes, both within D. melanogaster and across the Drosophila phylogeny. We find strong evidence for recurrent protein-coding adaptation at a large number of RNAi genes, particularly those involved in antiviral immunity and defense against transposable elements. We identify specific functional domains involved in direct protein-RNA interactions as particular hotspots of recurrent adaptation in multiple RNAi genes, suggesting that targeted coadaptive arms-races may be a general feature of RNAi evolution. Our observations suggest a predictive model of how selective pressures generated by evolutionary arms-race scenarios may affect multiple genes across protein interaction networks and other biochemical pathways.},

Here, via microarray analysis of all P450s in Drosophila melanogaster, we show that DDT-R, a gene conferring resistance to DDT, is associated with overtranscription of a single cytochrome P450 gene, Cyp6g1. Transgenic analysis of Cyp6g1 shows that overtranscription of this gene alone is both necessary and sufficient for resistance. Resistance and up-regulation in Drosophila populations are associated with a single Cyp6g1 allele that has spread globally. This allele is characterized by the insertion of an Accord transposable element into the 5' end of the Cyp6g1 gene.},

Nine restriction site polymorphisms (out of 176 sites scored) and 19 length polymorphisms (15 insertions and 4 deletions) were detected. The estimated level of heterozygosity per nucleotide, H = 0.0003, is much lower than that reported for autosomal and sex-linked loci located in regions with normal levels of crossing over. The overall frequency of polymorphic restriction sites is reduced. Six out of nine restriction site polymorphisms are unique and the other three have frequencies less than 0.17. Some large insertions have reached relatively high frequencies, 0.08 to 0.17. Consistent with the theoretically predicted negative relationship between crossing over and the magnitude of linkage disequilibrium, an increase in the relative number of nonrandom associations was observed in the y-ac-sc region.},

Here, we present the first survey of promoter (5'-flanking) regions, which are rich in cis-regulatory sequences, for evidence of positive selection in humans. Our results indicate that positive selection has targeted the regulation of many genes known to be involved in neural development and function, both in the brain and elsewhere in the nervous system, and in nutrition, particularly in glucose metabolism.},

	Abstract = {A primary motivation for sequencing the mouse genome was to accelerate the discovery of mammalian genes by using sequence conservation between mouse and human to identify coding exons. Achieving this goal proved challenging because of the large proportion of the mouse and human genomes that is apparently conserved but apparently does not code for protein. We developed a two-stage procedure that exploits the mouse and human genome sequences to produce a set of genes with a much higher rate of experimental verification than previously reported prediction methods. RT-PCR amplification and direct sequencing applied to an initial sample of mouse predictions that do not overlap previously known genes verified the regions flanking one intron in 139 predictions, with verification rates reaching 76\%. On average, the confirmed predictions show more restricted expression patterns than the mouse orthologs of known human genes, and two-thirds lack homologs in fish genomes, demonstrating the sensitivity of this dual-genome approach to hard-to-find genes. We verified 112 previously unknown homologs of known proteins, including two homeobox proteins relevant to developmental biology, an aquaporin, and a homolog of dystrophin. We estimate that transcription and splicing can be verified for >1,000 gene predictions identified by this method that do not overlap known genes. This is likely to constitute a significant fraction of the previously unknown, multiexon mammalian genes.},

We have given the statistical properties of F and shown how tests of heterogeneity can be made. Using data from human populations we have shown highly significant heterogeneity in F values for human polymorphic genes over the world, thus demonstrating that a significant fraction of human polymorphisms owe their current gene frequencies to the action of natural selection.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, contains a tremendous amount of information with respect to the mechanisms of the micro-evolutionary process of a species. The inference of the roles of these mechanisms, including natural selection, relies heavily on computer simulations. A coalescent simulation is extremely powerful in generating a large number of samples of DNA sequences from a population (species) when all mutations are neutral, and Hudson's ms software is frequently used for this purpose.However, it has been difficult to incorporate natural selection into the coalescent framework. RESULTS: We herein present a software application to generate samples of DNA sequences when there is a biallelic site targeted by selection. This software application, referred to as mbs, is developed by modifying Hudson's ms. The mbs software is so flexible that it can incorporate any arbitrary histories of population size changes and any mode of selection as long as selection is operating on a biallelic site. CONCLUSION: mbs provides opportunities to investigate the effect of any mode of selection on the pattern of SNPs under various demography.},

@article{Teshima:2006tg,
	Abstract = {The beneficial substitution of an allele shapes patterns of genetic variation at linked sites. Thus, in principle, adaptations can be mapped by looking for the signature of directional selection in polymorphism data. In practice, such efforts are hampered by the need for an accurate characterization of the demographic history of the species and of the effects of positive selection. In an attempt to circumvent these difficulties, researchers are increasingly taking a purely empirical approach, in which a large number of genomic regions are ordered by summaries of the polymorphism data, and loci with extreme values are considered to be likely targets of positive selection. We evaluated the reliability of the "empirical" approach, focusing on applications to human data and to maize. To do so, we considered a coalescent model of directional selection in a sensible demographic setting, allowing for selection on standing variation as well as on a new mutation. Our simulations suggest that while empirical approaches will identify several interesting candidates, they will also miss many--in some cases, most--loci of interest. The extent of the trade-off depends on the mode of positive selection and the demographic history of the population. Specifically, the false-discovery rate is higher when directional selection involves a recessive rather than a co-dominant allele, when it acts on a previously neutral rather than a new allele, and when the population has experienced a population bottleneck rather than maintained a constant size. One implication of these results is that, insofar as attributes of the beneficial mutation (e.g., the dominance coefficient) affect the power to detect targets of selection, genomic scans will yield an unrepresentative subset of loci that contribute to adaptations.},

	Abstract = {Quantifying the distribution of fitness effects among newly arising mutations in the human genome is key to resolving important debates in medical and evolutionary genetics. Here, we present a method for inferring this distribution using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data from a population with non-stationary demographic history (such as that of modern humans). Application of our method to 47,576 coding SNPs found by direct resequencing of 11,404 protein coding-genes in 35 individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans) allows us to assess the relative contribution of demographic and selective effects to patterning amino acid variation in the human genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in the sample with European ancestry. After accounting for these demographic effects, we find strong evidence for great variability in the selective effects of new amino acid replacing mutations. In both populations, the patterns of variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near neutrality. Specifically, we predict 27-29\% of amino acid changing (nonsynonymous) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral (|s|<0.01\%), 30-42\% are moderately deleterious (0.01\%<|s|<1\%), and nearly all the remainder are highly deleterious or lethal (|s|>1\%). Our results are consistent with 10-20\% of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees having been fixed by positive selection with the remainder of differences being neutral or nearly neutral. Our analysis also predicts that many of the alleles identified via whole-genome association mapping may be selectively neutral or (formerly) positively selected, implying that deleterious genetic variation affecting disease phenotype may be missed by this widely used approach for mapping genes underlying complex traits.},

Several previous model-based approaches to admixture have been based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Markov hidden Markov models (MHMMs). We present an augmented form of these models that can be used to predict historical recombination events and can model background linkage disequilibrium (LD) more accurately. We also study some of the computational issues that arise in using such Markovian models on realistic data sets. In particular, we present an effective initialization procedure that, when combined with expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms for parameter estimation, yields high accuracy at significantly decreased computational cost relative to the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that have generally been used in earlier studies. We present experiments exploring these modeling and algorithmic issues in two scenarios-the inference of locus-specific ancestries in a population that is assumed to originate from two unknown ancestral populations, and the inference of allele frequencies in one ancestral population given those in another.},

	Abstract = {Quantifying patterns of population structure in Africans and African Americans illuminates the history of human populations and is critical for undertaking medical genomic studies on a global scale. To obtain a fine-scale genome-wide perspective of ancestry, we analyze Affymetrix GeneChip 500K genotype data from African Americans (n = 365) and individuals with ancestry from West Africa (n = 203 from 12 populations) and Europe (n = 400 from 42 countries). We find that population structure within the West African sample reflects primarily language and secondarily geographical distance, echoing the Bantu expansion. Among African Americans, analysis of genomic admixture by a principal component-based approach indicates that the median proportion of European ancestry is 18.5\% (25th-75th percentiles: 11.6-27.7\%), with very large variation among individuals. In the African-American sample as a whole, few autosomal regions showed exceptionally high or low mean African ancestry, but the X chromosome showed elevated levels of African ancestry, consistent with a sex-biased pattern of gene flow with an excess of European male and African female ancestry. We also find that genomic profiles of individual African Americans afford personalized ancestry reconstructions differentiating ancient vs. recent European and African ancestry. Finally, patterns of genetic similarity among inferred African segments of African-American genomes and genomes of contemporary African populations included in this study suggest African ancestry is most similar to non-Bantu Niger-Kordofanian-speaking populations, consistent with historical documents of the African Diaspora and trans-Atlantic slave trade.},

	Abstract = {We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data to infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

	Abstract = {We describe extensions to the method of Pritchard et al. for inferring population structure from multilocus genotype data. Most importantly, we develop methods that allow for linkage between loci. The new model accounts for the correlations between linked loci that arise in admixed populations ("admixture linkage disequilibium"). This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions, and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method. We present results applying the new methods to study admixture in African-Americans, recombination in Helicobacter pylori, and drift in populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The methods are implemented in a program, structure, version 2.0, which is available at http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu.},

	Abstract = {The genome of an admixed individual represents a mixture of alleles from different ancestries. In the United States, the two largest minority groups, African-Americans and Hispanics, are both admixed. An understanding of the admixture proportion at an individual level (individual admixture, or IA) is valuable for both population geneticists and epidemiologists who conduct case-control association studies in these groups. Here we present an extension of a previously described frequentist (maximum likelihood or ML) approach to estimate individual admixture that allows for uncertainty in ancestral allele frequencies. We compare this approach both to prior partial likelihood based methods as well as more recently described Bayesian MCMC methods. Our full ML method demonstrates increased robustness when compared to an existing partial ML approach. Simulations also suggest that this frequentist estimator achieves similar efficiency, measured by the mean squared error criterion, as Bayesian methods but requires just a fraction of the computational time to produce point estimates, allowing for extensive analysis (e.g., simulations) not possible by Bayesian methods. Our simulation results demonstrate that inclusion of ancestral populations or their surrogates in the analysis is required by any method of IA estimation to obtain reasonable results.},

	Abstract = {A chromosome in an individual of recently admixed ancestry resembles a mosaic of chromosomal segments, or ancestry blocks, each derived from a particular ancestral population. We consider the problem of inferring ancestry along the chromosomes in an admixed individual and thereby delineating the ancestry blocks. Using a simple population model, we infer gene-flow history in each individual. Compared with existing methods, which are based on a hidden Markov model, the Markov-hidden Markov model (MHMM) we propose has the advantage of accounting for the background linkage disequilibrium (LD) that exists in ancestral populations. When there are more than two ancestral groups, we allow each ancestral population to admix at a different time in history. We use simulations to illustrate the accuracy of the inferred ancestry as well as the importance of modeling the background LD; not accounting for background LD between markers may mislead us to false inferences about mixed ancestry in an indigenous population. The MHMM makes it possible to identify genomic blocks of a particular ancestry by use of any high-density single-nucleotide-polymorphism panel. One application of our method is to perform admixture mapping without genotyping special ancestry-informative-marker panels.},

However, because these new technologies are error prone and yield uneven coverage of alleles in diploid individuals, they also introduce the need for novel methods for analyzing the raw read data. A maximum-likelihood method for the estimation of allele frequencies is developed, eliminating both the need to arbitrarily discard individuals with low coverage and the requirement for an extrinsic measure of the sequence error rate. The resultant estimates are nearly unbiased with asymptotically minimal sampling variance, thereby defining the limits to our ability to estimate population-genetic parameters and providing a logical basis for the optimal design of population-genomic surveys.},

	Abstract = {It is estimated that a large proportion of amino acid substitutions in Drosophila have been fixed by natural selection, and as organisms are faced with an ever-changing array of pathogens and parasites to which they must adapt, we have investigated the role of parasite-mediated selection as a likely cause. To quantify the effect, and to identify which genes and pathways are most likely to be involved in the host-parasite arms race, we have re-sequenced population samples of 136 immunity and 287 position-matched non-immunity genes in two species of Drosophila. Using these data, and a new extension of the McDonald-Kreitman approach, we estimate that natural selection fixes advantageous amino acid changes in immunity genes at nearly double the rate of other genes. We find the rate of adaptive evolution in immunity genes is also more variable than other genes, with a small subset of immune genes evolving under intense selection. These genes, which are likely to represent hotspots of host-parasite coevolution, tend to share similar functions or belong to the same pathways, such as the antiviral RNAi pathway and the IMD signalling pathway. These patterns appear to be general features of immune system evolution in both species, as rates of adaptive evolution are correlated between the D. melanogaster and D. simulans lineages. In summary, our data provide quantitative estimates of the elevated rate of adaptive evolution in immune system genes relative to the rest of the genome, and they suggest that adaptation to parasites is an important force driving molecular evolution.},

Such an understanding will be of general biological interest, but could also facilitate the design and interpretation of disease-mapping studies.

When nuclear sequences are considered together with mtDNA and microsatellites, it becomes clear that neither the standard neutral model, nor a simple long-term exponential growth model, can account for all the available human variation data. A possible explanation is that a subset of loci are not evolving neutrally; even so, more-complex models of effective population size and structure might be necessary to explain the data.},

@article{Andreev:1999fk,
	Abstract = {The number of origins of pesticide resistance-associated mutations is important not only to our understanding of the evolution of resistance but also in modeling its spread. Previous studies of amplified esterase genes in a highly dispersive Culex mosquito have suggested that insecticide resistance-associated mutations (specifically a single-gene duplication event) can occur a single time and then spread throughout global populations. In order to provide data for resistance-associated point mutations, which are more typical of pesticide mechanisms as a whole, we studied the number of independent origins of cyclodiene insecticide resistance in the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. Target-site insensitivity to cyclodienes is conferred by single point mutations in the gene Resistance to dieldrin (Rdl), which codes for a subunit of a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor. These point mutations are associated with replacements of alanine 302 which render the receptor insensitive to block by the insecticide. We collected 141 strains of Tribolium worldwide and screened them for resistance. Twenty-four strains contained resistant individuals. After homozygosing 23 of these resistance alleles we derived a nucleotide sequence phylogeny of the resistant strains from a 694-bp section of Rdl, encompassing exon 7 (which contains the resistance-associated mutation) and part of a flanking intron. The phylogeny also included six susceptible alleles chosen at random from a range of geographical locations. Resistance alleles fell into six clades and three clades contained both resistant and susceptible alleles. Although statistical analysis provided support at only the 5-6\% level, the pattern of variation in resistance alleles is more readily explained by multiple independent origins of resistance than by spread of a single resistance-associated mutation. For example, two resistance alleles differed from two susceptible alleles only by the resistance-associated mutation itself, suggesting that they form the susceptible ancestors and that resistance arose independently in several susceptible backgrounds. This suggests that in Tribolium Rdl, de novo mutations for resistance have arisen independently in several populations. Identical alleles were found in geographically distant regions as well, also implying that some Rdl alleles have been exported in stored grain. These differences from the Culex study may stem both from differences in the population genetics of Tribolium versus that of mosquitoes and differences in mutation rates associated with point mutations versus gene duplication events. The Tribolium data therefore suggest that multiple origins of insecticide resistance (associated with specific point mutations) may be more common than the spread of single events. These findings have implications for the way in which we model the evolution and spread of insecticide resistance genes and also suggest that parallel adaptive substitutions may not be uncommon in phyletic evolution.},

	Abstract = {Polymorphism data can be used to identify loci at which a beneficial allele has recently gone to fixation, given that an accurate description of the signature of selection is available. In the classical model that is used, a favored allele derives from a single mutational origin. This ignores the fact that beneficial alleles can enter a population recurrently by mutation during the selective phase. In this study, we present a combination of analytical and simulation results to demonstrate the effect of adaptation from recurrent mutation on summary statistics for polymorphism data from a linked neutral locus. We also analyze the power of standard neutrality tests based on the frequency spectrum or on linkage disequilibrium (LD) under this scenario. For recurrent beneficial mutation at biologically realistic rates, we find substantial deviations from the classical pattern of a selective sweep from a single new mutation. Deviations from neutrality in the level of polymorphism and in the frequency spectrum are much less pronounced than in the classical sweep pattern. In contrast, for levels of LD, the signature is even stronger if recurrent beneficial mutation plays a role. We suggest a variant of existing LD tests that increases their power to detect this signature.},

	Abstract = {Genetic hitchhiking describes evolution at a neutral locus that is linked to a selected locus. If a beneficial allele rises to fixation at the selected locus, a characteristic polymorphism pattern (so-called selective sweep) emerges at the neutral locus. The classical model assumes that fixation of the beneficial allele occurs from a single copy of this allele that arises by mutation. However, recent theory [Pennings and Hermisson, 2006a, b] has shown that recurrent beneficial mutation at biologically realistic rates can lead to markedly different polymorphism patterns, so-called soft selective sweeps. We extend an approach that has recently been developed for the classical hitchhiking model [Schweinsberg and Durrett, 2005; Etheridge et al., 2006] to study the recurrent mutation scenario. We show that the genealogy at the neutral locus can be approximated (to leading orders in the selection strength) by a marked Yule process with immigration. Using this formalism, we derive an improved analytical approximation for the expected heterozygosity at the neutral locus at the time of fixation of the beneficial allele.},

	Abstract = {The genetic variance-covariance matrix, G, is determined in part by functional architecture, the pathways by which variation in genotype influences phenotype. I develop a simple architectural model for G for two traits under directional selection constrained by their dependence on a common limiting resource. I assume that genetic variance is maintained by mutation-selection balance. The relative numbers of loci that play a role in acquiring versus allocating a limiting resource play a crucial role in determining genetic covariance. If many loci are involved in acquiring a resource, genetic covariance may be either negative or positive at equilibrium, depending on the fitness function and the input of mutational variance. The form of G does not necessarily reveal the constraint on resource acquisition inherent in the system, and therefore studies estimating G do not test for the existence of life-history tradeoffs. Characters may evolve in patterns that are unpredictable from G. Experiments are suggested that would indicate if this model could explain observations of positive genetic covariance.},

@article{landeArnold,
	Abstract = {Multivariate statistical methods are derived for measuring selection solely from observed changes in the distribution of phenotypic characters in a population within a generation. Selective effects are readily detectable in characters that do not change with age, such as meristic traits or adult characters in species with determinate growth. Ontogenetic characters, including allometric growth rates, can be analyzed in longitudinal studies where individuals are followed through time. Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this analysis helps to reveal the target(s) of selection, and to quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through correlated characters, separate forces of directional and stabilizing (or disruptive) selection acting directly on each character can be measured. These directional and stabilizing selection coefficients are respectively the parameters that describe the best linear and quadratic approximations to the selective surface of individual fitness as a function of the phenotypic characters. The theory is illustrated by estimating selective forces on morphological characters influencing survival in pentatomid bugs and in house sparrows during severe weather conditions.},

	Abstract = {We consider populations that adapt to a sudden environmental change by fixing alleles found at mutation-selection balance. In particular, we calculate probabilities of fixation for previously deleterious alleles, ignoring the input of new mutations. We find that "Haldane's sieve"--the bias against the establishment of recessive beneficial mutations--does not hold under these conditions. Instead probabilities of fixation are generally independent of dominance. We show that this result is robust to patterns of sex expression for both X-linked and autosomal loci. We further show that adaptive evolution is invariably slower at X-linked than autosomal loci when evolution begins from mutation-selection balance. This result differs from that obtained when adaptation uses new mutations, a finding that may have some bearing on recent attempts to distinguish between hitchhiking and background selection by contrasting the molecular population genetics of X-linked vs. autosomal loci. Last, we suggest a test to determine whether adaptation used new mutations or previously deleterious alleles from the standing genetic variation.},

	Abstract = {Until recently, the use of Bayesian inference was limited to a few cases because for many realistic probability models the likelihood function cannot be calculated analytically. The situation changed with the advent of likelihood-free inference algorithms, often subsumed under the term approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). A key innovation was the use of a postsampling regression adjustment, allowing larger tolerance values and as such shifting computation time to realistic orders of magnitude. Here we propose a reformulation of the regression adjustment in terms of a general linear model (GLM). This allows the integration into the sound theoretical framework of Bayesian statistics and the use of its methods, including model selection via Bayes factors. We then apply the proposed methodology to the question of population subdivision among western chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus.},

	Abstract = {The recurrent fixation of newly arising, beneficial mutations in a species reduces levels of linked neutral variability. Models positing frequent weakly beneficial substitutions or, alternatively, rare, strongly selected substitutions predict similar average effects on linked neutral variability, if the product of the rate and strength of selection is held constant. We propose an approximate Bayesian (ABC) polymorphism-based estimator that can be used to distinguish between these models, and apply it to multi-locus data from Drosophila melanogaster. We investigate the extent to which inference about the strength of selection is sensitive to assumptions about the underlying distributions of the rates of substitution and recombination, the strength of selection, heterogeneity in mutation rate, as well as the population's demographic history. We show that assuming fixed values of selection parameters in estimation leads to overestimates of the strength of selection and underestimates of the rate. We estimate parameters for an African population of D. melanogaster ({\^s} approximately 2E-03, ) and compare these to previous estimates. Finally, we show that surveying larger genomic regions is expected to lend much more discriminatory power to the approach. It will thus be of great interest to apply this method to emerging whole-genome polymorphism data sets in many taxa.},

	Abstract = {An infinite-site neutral allele model with crossing-over possible at any of an infinite number of sites is studied. A formula for the variance of the number of segregating sites in a sample of gametes is obtained. An approximate expression for the expected homozygosity is also derived. Simulation results are presented to indicate the accuracy of the approximations. The results concerning the number of segregating sites and the expected homozygosity indicate that a two-locus model and the infinite-site model behave similarly for 4Nu less than or equal to 2 and r less than or equal to 5u, where N is the population size, u is the neutral mutation rate, and r is the recombination rate. Simulations of a two-locus model and a four-locus model were also carried out to determine the effect of intragenic recombination on the homozygosity test of Watterson (Genetics 85, 789-814; 88, 405-417) and on the number of unique alleles in a sample. The results indicate that for 4Nu less than or equal to 2 and r less than or equal to 10u, the effect of recombination is quite small.},

Here we report an analysis of over 3 million polymorphisms from the International HapMap Project Phase 2 (HapMap2). We used 'long-range haplotype' methods, which were developed to identify alleles segregating in a population that have undergone recent selection, and we also developed new methods that are based on cross-population comparisons to discover alleles that have swept to near-fixation within a population. The analysis reveals more than 300 strong candidate regions. Focusing on the strongest 22 regions, we develop a heuristic for scrutinizing these regions to identify candidate targets of selection. In a complementary analysis, we identify 26 non-synonymous, coding, single nucleotide polymorphisms showing regional evidence of positive selection. Examination of these candidates highlights three cases in which two genes in a common biological process have apparently undergone positive selection in the same population:LARGE and DMD, both related to infection by the Lassa virus, in West Africa;SLC24A5 and SLC45A2, both involved in skin pigmentation, in Europe; and EDAR and EDA2R, both involved in development of hair follicles, in Asia.},

@article{Kern:2008vn,
	Abstract = {Although Drosophila melanogaster has been the subject of intensive analysis of polymorphism and divergence, little is known about the distribution of variation at the most distal regions of chromosomes arms. Here we report a survey of genetic variation on the tip of 3L in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Levels of single nucleotide polymorphism in the most distal euchromatic sequence are approximately one order of magnitude less than that typically observed in genomic regions of normal crossing over, consistent with what might be expected under models of linked selection in regions of low crossing over. However, despite this reduced level of nucleotide variation, we found abundant deletion polymorphism. These deletions create at least three gene presence/absence polymorphisms within D. melanogaster: the putative G-protein coupled receptor mthl-8 (which is the most distal known or predicted gene on 3L) and the unannotated mRNAs AY060886 and BT006009. Strikingly, D. simulans is also segregating deletions that cause mthl8 presence/absence polymorphism. Breakpoint sequencing and tests of correlations with segregating SNPs in D. melanogaster suggest that each deletion is unique. Cloned breakpoint sequences revealed the presence of Het-A elements just distal to unique, canonical euchromatic sequences. This pattern suggests a model in which repeated telomeric deficiencies cause deletions of euchromatic sequence followed by subsequent "healing" by retrotranposition of Het-A elements.

	Abstract = {Recent experiments using sperm typing have demonstrated that, in several regions of the human genome, recombination does not occur uniformly but instead is concentrated in "hotspots" of 1-2 kb. Moreover, the crossover asymmetry observed in a subset of these has led to the suggestion that hotspots may be short-lived on an evolutionary time scale. To test this possibility, we focused on a region known to contain a recombination hotspot in humans, TAP2, and asked whether chimpanzees, the closest living evolutionary relatives of humans, harbor a hotspot in a similar location. Specifically, we used a new statistical approach to estimate recombination rate variation from patterns of linkage disequilibrium in a sample of 24 western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus). This method has been shown to produce reliable results on simulated data and on human data from the TAP2 region. Strikingly, however, it finds very little support for recombination rate variation at TAP2 in the western chimpanzee data. Moreover, simulations suggest that there should be stronger support if there were a hotspot similar to the one characterized in humans. Thus, it appears that the human TAP2 recombination hotspot is not shared by western chimpanzees. These findings demonstrate that fine-scale recombination rates can change between very closely related species and raise the possibility that rates differ among human populations, with important implications for linkage-disequilibrium based association studies.},

	Abstract = {Although sequences containing regulatory elements located close to protein-coding genes are often only weakly conserved during evolution, comparisons of rodent genomes have implied that these sequences are subject to some selective constraints. Evolutionary conservation is particularly apparent upstream of coding sequences and in first introns, regions that are enriched for regulatory elements. By comparing the human and chimpanzee genomes, we show here that there is almost no evidence for conservation in these regions in hominids. Furthermore, we show that gene expression is diverging more rapidly in hominids than in murids per unit of neutral sequence divergence. By combining data on polymorphism levels in human noncoding DNA and the corresponding human-chimpanzee divergence, we show that the proportion of adaptive substitutions in these regions in hominids is very low. It therefore seems likely that the lack of conservation and increased rate of gene expression divergence are caused by a reduction in the effectiveness of natural selection against deleterious mutations because of the low effective population sizes of hominids. This has resulted in the accumulation of a large number of deleterious mutations in sequences containing gene control elements and hence a widespread degradation of the genome during the evolution of humans and chimpanzees.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary relationships are typically inferred from molecular sequence data using a statistical model of the evolutionary process. When the model accurately reflects the underlying process, probabilistic phylogenetic methods recover the correct relationships with high accuracy. There is ample evidence, however, that models commonly used today do not adequately reflect real-world evolutionary dynamics. Virtually all contemporary models assume that relatively fast-evolving sites are fast across the entire tree, whereas slower sites always evolve at relatively slower rates. Many molecular sequences, however, exhibit site-specific changes in evolutionary rates, called "heterotachy." Here we examine the accuracy of 2 phylogenetic methods for incorporating heterotachy, the mixed branch length model--which incorporates site-specific rate changes by summing likelihoods over multiple sets of branch lengths on the same tree--and the covarion model, which uses a hidden Markov process to allow sites to switch between variable and invariable as they evolve. Under a variety of simple heterogeneous simulation conditions, the mixed model was dramatically more accurate than homotachous models, which were subject to topological biases as well as biases in branch length estimates. When data were simulated with strong versions of the types of heterotachy observed in real molecular sequences, the mixed branch length model was more accurate than homotachous techniques. Analyses of empirical data sets confirmed that the mixed branch length model can improve phylogenetic accuracy under conditions that cause homotachous models to fail. In contrast, the covarion model did not improve phylogenetic accuracy compared with homotachous models and was sometimes substantially less accurate. We conclude that a mixed branch length approach, although not the solution to all phylogenetic errors, is a valuable strategy for improving the accuracy of inferred trees.},

	Abstract = {Methods for detecting nucleotide substitution rates that are faster or slower than expected under neutral drift are widely used to identify candidate functional elements in genomic sequences. However, most existing methods consider either reductions (conservation) or increases (acceleration) in rate but not both, or assume that selection acts uniformly across the branches of a phylogeny. Here we examine the more general problem of detecting departures from the neutral rate of substitution in either direction, possibly in a clade-specific manner. We consider four statistical, phylogenetic tests for addressing this problem: a likelihood ratio test, a score test, a test based on exact distributions of numbers of substitutions, and the genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) test. All four tests have been implemented in a freely available program called phyloP. Based on extensive simulation experiments, these tests are remarkably similar in statistical power. With 36 mammalian species, they all appear to be capable of fairly good sensitivity with low false-positive rates in detecting strong selection at individual nucleotides, moderate selection in 3-bp elements, and weaker or clade-specific selection in longer elements. By applying phyloP to mammalian multiple alignments from the ENCODE project, we shed light on patterns of conservation/acceleration in known and predicted functional elements, approximate fractions of sites subject to constraint, and differences in clade-specific selection in the primate and glires clades. We also describe new "Conservation" tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser that display both phyloP and phastCons scores for genome-wide alignments of 44 vertebrate species.},

	Abstract = {A few models have appeared in recent years that consider not only the way substitutions occur through evolutionary history at each site of a genome, but also the way the process changes from one site to the next. These models combine phylogenetic models of molecular evolution, which apply to individual sites, and hidden Markov models, which allow for changes from site to site. Besides improving the realism of ordinary phylogenetic models, they are potentially very powerful tools for inference and prediction-for example, for gene finding or prediction of secondary structure. In this paper, we review progress on combined phylogenetic and hidden Markov models and present some extensions to previous work. Our main result is a simple and efficient method for accommodating higher-order states in the HMM, which allows for context-dependent models of substitution-that is, models that consider the effects of neighboring bases on the pattern of substitution. We present experimental results indicating that higher-order states, autocorrelated rates, and multiple functional categories all lead to significant improvements in the fit of a combined phylogenetic and hidden Markov model, with the effect of higher-order states being particularly pronounced.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted a comprehensive search for conserved elements in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3\%-8\% of the human genome (depending on the details of the calibration procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact Drosophila melanogaster (37\%-53\%), Caenorhabditis elegans (18\%-37\%), and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae (47\%-68\%) genomes. From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share certain properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA secondary structure.},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide scans for positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals have provided insight into the dynamics of genome evolution, the genetic basis of differences between species, and the functions of individual genes. However, previous scans have been limited in power and accuracy owing to small numbers of available genomes. Here we present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date, using the six high-coverage genome assemblies now available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in substantially improved statistical power, and permits several new lineage- and clade-specific tests to be applied. Of approximately 16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR<0.05), according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. As in previous studies, the identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but enrichments were also evident for more specific functions, such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis of the possible "selection histories" of each gene indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. A detailed analysis of Affymetrix exon array data indicated that PSGs are expressed at significantly lower levels, and in a more tissue-specific manner, than non-PSGs. Genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.},

	Abstract = {In Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Drosophila melanogaster, codon bias may be maintained by a balance among mutation pressure, genetic drift, and natural selection favoring translationally superior codons. Under such an evolutionary model, silent mutations fall into two fitness categories: preferred mutations that increase codon bias and unpreferred changes in the opposite direction. This prediction can be tested by comparing the frequency spectra of synonymous changes segregating within populations; natural selection will elevate the frequencies of advantageous mutations relative to that of deleterious changes. The frequency distributions of preferred and unpreferred mutations differ in the predicted direction among 99 alleles of two D. pseudoobscura genes and five alleles of eight D. simulans genes. This result confirms the existence of fitness classes of silent mutations. Maximum likelihood estimates suggest that selection intensity at silent sites is, on average, very weak in both D. pseudoobscura and D. simulans (magnitude of NS approximately 1). Inference of evolutionary processes from within-species sequence variation is often hindered by the assumption of a stationary frequency distribution. This assumption can be avoided when identifying the action of selection and tested when estimating selection intensity.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive codon usage provides evidence of natural selection in one of its most subtle forms: a fitness benefit of one synonymous codon relative to another. Codon usage bias is evident in the coding sequences of a broad array of taxa, reflecting selection for translational efficiency and/or accuracy as well as mutational biases. Here, we quantify the magnitude of selection acting on alternative codons in genes of the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei, an outcrossing relative of the model organism C. elegans, by fitting the expected mutation-selection-drift equilibrium frequency distribution of preferred and unpreferred codon variants to the empirical distribution. This method estimates the intensity of selection on synonymous codons in genes with high codon bias as N(e)s = 0.17, a value significantly greater than zero. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that estimates of ongoing selection on codon usage among genes, inferred from nucleotide polymorphism data, correlate strongly with long-term patterns of codon usage bias, as measured by the frequency of optimal codons in a gene. From the pattern of polymorphisms in introns, we also infer that these findings do not result from the operation of biased gene conversion toward G or C nucleotides. We therefore conclude that coincident patterns of current and ancient selection are responsible for shaping biased codon usage in the C. remanei genome.},

	Abstract = {An excess of nonsynonymous substitutions over synonymous ones is an important indicator of positive selection at the molecular level. A lineage that underwent Darwinian selection may have a nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (dN/dS) that is different from those of other lineages or greater than one. In this paper, several codon-based likelihood models that allow for variable dN/dS ratios among lineages were developed. They were then used to construct likelihood ratio tests to examine whether the dN/dS ratio is variable among evolutionary lineages, whether the ratio for a few lineages of interest is different from the background ratio for other lineages in the phylogeny, and whether the dN/dS ratio for the lineages of interest is greater than one. The tests were applied to the lysozyme genes of 24 primate species. The dN/dS ratios were found to differ significantly among lineages, indicating that the evolution of primate lysozymes is episodic, which is incompatible with the neutral theory. Maximum-likelihood estimates of parameters suggested that about nine nonsynonymous and zero synonymous nucleotide substitutions occurred in the lineage leading to hominoids, and the dN/dS ratio for that lineage is significantly greater than one. The corresponding estimates for the lineage ancestral to colobine monkeys were nine and one, and the dN/dS ratio for the lineage is not significantly greater than one, although it is significantly higher than the background ratio. The likelihood analysis thus confirmed most, but not all, conclusions Messier and Stewart reached using reconstructed ancestral sequences to estimate synonymous and nonsynonymous rates for different lineages.},

Several methods have been developed to test positive selection that acts on given branches (branch methods) or on a subset of sites (site methods). Recently, Yang, Z., and R. Nielsen (2002. Codon-substitution models for detecting molecular adaptation at individual sites along specific lineages. Mol. Biol. Evol. 19:908-917) developed likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) based on branch-site models to detect positive selection that affects a small number of sites along prespecified lineages. However, computer simulations suggested that the tests were sensitive to the model assumptions and were unable to distinguish between relaxation of selective constraint and positive selection (Zhang, J. 2004. Frequent false detection of positive selection by the likelihood method with branch-site models. Mol. Biol. Evol. 21:1332-1339). Here, we describe a modified branch-site model and use it to construct two LRTs, called branch-site tests 1 and 2. We applied the new tests to reanalyze several real data sets and used computer simulation to examine the performance of the two tests by examining their false-positive rate, power, and robustness. We found that test 1 was unable to distinguish relaxed constraint from positive selection affecting the lineages of interest, while test 2 had acceptable false-positive rates and appeared robust against violations of model assumptions. As test 2 is a direct test of positive selection on the lineages of interest, it is referred to as the branch-site test of positive selection and is recommended for use in real data analysis. The test appeared conservative overall, but exhibited better power in detecting positive selection than the branch-based test. Bayes empirical Bayes identification of amino acid sites under positive selection along the foreground branches was found to be reliable, but lacked power.},

@article{Anisimova:2007hs,
	Abstract = {Detection of positive Darwinian selection has become ever more important with the rapid growth of genomic data sets. Recent branch-site models of codon substitution account for variation of selective pressure over branches on the tree and across sites in the sequence and provide a means to detect short episodes of molecular adaptation affecting just a few sites. In likelihood ratio tests based on such models, the branches to be tested for positive selection have to be specified a priori. In the absence of a biological hypothesis to designate so-called foreground branches, one may test many branches, but a correction for multiple testing becomes necessary. In this paper, we employ computer simulation to evaluate the performance of 6 multiple test correction procedures when the branch-site models are used to test every branch on the phylogeny for positive selection. Four of the methods control the familywise error rates (FWERs), whereas the other 2 control the false discovery rate (FDR). We found that all correction procedures achieved acceptable FWER except for extremely divergent sequences and serious model violations, when the test may become unreliable. The power of the test to detect positive selection is influenced by the strength of selection and the sequence divergence, with the highest power observed at intermediate divergences. The 4 correction procedures that control the FWER had similar power. We recommend Rom's procedure for its slightly higher power, but the simple Bonferroni correction is useable as well. The 2 correction procedures that control the FDR had slightly more power and also higher FWER, We demonstrate the multiple test procedures by analyzing gene sequences from the extracellular domain of the cluster of differentiation 2 (CD2) gene from 10 mammalian species. Both our simulation and real data analysis suggest that the Multiple test procedures are useful when multiple branches have to be tested on the same data set.},

	Abstract = {Human chromosomes are heterogeneous in structure and function and this is the base for the specific banding patterns produced by various chromosome staining techniques. The Human Genome Data Base as of January 2001 was searched for genes mapped to individual chromosomal bands to study the different aspects of human genome organization as they appear at the cytogenetic level of resolution. Genes are unequally distributed both on human chromosomes and chromosome bands. Among more than 5000 genes mapped at individual bands. 81 \% were located in G-negative bands, which correspond to half of the human genome. The main practical value of having a dense genetic physical map of genes is to accelerate the discovery by positional candidate cloning of human disease genes. Gene content agrees with H3 family isochores and with GC-rich flavors. Interestingly. two G-positive bands, namely 2p chromosome bandings is 12 and 7q35, contain a high number of genes. The finding of heterogeneity in gene content suggests that chromosome banding is not only due to differences in gene content. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Fluctuations in base composition appear to be prevalent in Drosophila and mammal genome evolution, but their timescale, genomic breadth, and causes remain obscure. Here, we study base composition evolution within the X chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster and five of its close relatives. Substitutions were inferred on six extant and two ancestral lineages for 14 near-telomeric and 9 nontelomeric genes. GC content evolution is highly variable both within the genome and within the phylogenetic tree. In the lineages leading to D. yakuba and D. orena, GC content at silent sites has increased rapidly near telomeres, but has decreased in more proximal (nontelomeric) regions. D. orena shows a 17-fold excess of GC-increasing vs. AT-increasing synonymous changes within a small (similar to 130-kb) region close to the telomeric end. Base composition changes within introns are consistent with changes in mutation patterns, but stronger GC elevation at synonymous sites suggests contributions of natural selection or biased gene conversion. The Drosophila yakuba lineage shows a less extreme elevation of GC content distributed over a wider genetic region (similar to 1.2 Mb). A lack of change in GC content for most introns within this region suggests a role of natural selection in localized base composition fluctuations.},

Here we report an analysis of the genome sequence of P. falciparum clone 3D7. The 23-megabase nuclear genome consists of 14 chromosomes, encodes about 5,300 genes, and is the most (A + T)-rich genome sequenced to date. Genes involved in antigenic variation are concentrated in the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes. Compared to the genomes of free-living eukaryotic microbes, the genome of this intracellular parasite encodes fewer enzymes and transporters, but a large proportion of genes are devoted to immune evasion and host-parasite interactions. Many nuclear-encoded proteins are targeted to the apicoplast, an organelle involved in fatty-acid and isoprenoid metabolism. The genome sequence provides the foundation for future studies of this organism, and is being exploited in the search for new drugs and vaccines to fight malaria.},

	Abstract = {Proteins function mainly through interactions, especially with DNA and other proteins. While some large-scale interaction networks are now available for a number of model organisms, their experimental generation remains difficult. Consequently, interolog mapping--the transfer of interaction annotation from one organism to another using comparative genomics--is of significant value. Here we quantitatively assess the degree to which interologs can be reliably transferred between species as a function of the sequence similarity of the corresponding interacting proteins. Using interaction information from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Helicobacter pylori, we find that protein-protein interactions can be transferred when a pair of proteins has a joint sequence identity >80\% or a joint E-value <10(-70). (These "joint" quantities are the geometric means of the identities or E-values for the two pairs of interacting proteins.) We generalize our interolog analysis to protein-DNA binding, finding such interactions are conserved at specific thresholds between 30\% and 60\% sequence identity depending on the protein family. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a "regulog"--a conserved regulatory relationship between proteins across different species. We map interologs and regulogs from yeast to a number of genomes with limited experimental annotation (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana) and make these available through an online database at http://interolog.gersteinlab.org. Specifically, we are able to transfer approximately 90,000 potential protein-protein interactions to the worm. We test a number of these in two-hybrid experiments and are able to verify 45 overlaps, which we show to be statistically significant.},

	Abstract = {Protein phosphorylation is estimated to affect 30\% of the proteome and is a major regulatory mechanism that controls many basic cellular processes. Until recently, our biochemical understanding of protein phosphorylation on a global scale has been extremely limited; only one half of the yeast kinases have known in vivo substrates and the phosphorylating kinase is known for less than 160 phosphoproteins. Here we describe, with the use of proteome chip technology, the in vitro substrates recognized by most yeast protein kinases: we identified over 4,000 phosphorylation events involving 1,325 different proteins. These substrates represent a broad spectrum of different biochemical functions and cellular roles. Distinct sets of substrates were recognized by each protein kinase, including closely related kinases of the protein kinase A family and four cyclin-dependent kinases that vary only in their cyclin subunits. Although many substrates reside in the same cellular compartment or belong to the same functional category as their phosphorylating kinase, many others do not, indicating possible new roles for several kinases. Furthermore, integration of the phosphorylation results with protein-protein interaction and transcription factor binding data revealed novel regulatory modules. Our phosphorylation results have been assembled into a first-generation phosphorylation map for yeast. Because many yeast proteins and pathways are conserved, these results will provide insights into the mechanisms and roles of protein phosphorylation in many eukaryotes.},

	Abstract = {Identification of functional genomic regions using interspecies comparison will be most effective when the full span of relationships between genomic function and evolutionary constraint are utilized. We find that sets of putative transcriptional regulatory sequences, defined by ENCODE experimental data, have a wide span of evolutionary histories, ranging from stringent constraint shown by deep phylogenetic comparisons to recent selection on lineage-specific elements. This diversity of evolutionary histories can be captured, at least in part, by the suite of available comparative genomics tools, especially after correction for regional differences in the neutral substitution rate. Putative transcriptional regulatory regions show alignability in different clades, and the genes associated with them are enriched for distinct functions. Some of the putative regulatory regions show evidence for recent selection, including a primate-specific, distal promoter that may play a novel role in regulation.},

	Abstract = {Pseudogenes are common in mammals but virtually absent in Drosophila. All putative Drosophila pseudogenes show patterns of molecular evolution that are inconsistent with the lack of functional constraints. The absence of bona fide pseudogenes is not only puzzling, it also hampers attempts to estimate rates and patterns of neutral DNA change. The estimation problem is especially acute in the case of deletions and insertions, which are likely to have large effects when they occur in functional genes and are therefore subject to strong purifying selection. We propose a solution to this problem by taking advantage of the propensity of retrotransposable elements without long terminal repeats (non-LTR) to create non-functional, 'dead-on-arrival' copies of themselves as a common by-product of their transpositional cycle. Phylogenetic analysis of a non-LTR element, Helena, demonstrates that copies lose DNA at an unusually high rate, suggesting that lack of pseudogenes in Drosophila is the product of rampant deletion of DNA in unconstrained regions. This finding has important implications for the study of genome evolution in general and the 'C-value paradox' in particular.},

@article{Delmotte:2006zt,
	Abstract = {Background: Understanding evolutionary processes that drive genome reduction requires determining the tempo ( rate) and the mode ( size and types of deletions) of gene losses. In this study, we analysed five endosymbiotic genome sequences of the gamma-proteobacteria ( three different Buchnera aphidicola strains, Wigglesworthia glossinidia, Blochmannia floridanus) to test if gene loss could be driven by the selective importance of genes. We used a parsimony method to reconstruct a minimal ancestral genome of insect endosymbionts and quantified gene loss along the branches of the phylogenetic tree. To evaluate the selective or functional importance of genes, we used a parameter that measures the level of adaptive codon bias in E. coli (i. e. codon adaptive index, or CAI), and also estimates of evolutionary rates (Ka) between pairs of orthologs either in freeliving bacteria or in pairs of symbionts.

Results: Our results demonstrate that genes lost in the early stages of symbiosis were on average less selectively constrained than genes conserved in any of the extant symbiotic strains studied. These results also extend to more recent events of gene losses (i.e. among Buchnera strains) that still tend to concentrate on genes with low adaptive bias in E. coli and high evolutionary rates both in free-living and in symbiotic lineages. In addition, we analyzed the physical organization of gene losses for early steps of symbiosis acquisition under the hypothesis of a common origin of different symbioses. In contrast with previous findings we show that gene losses mostly occurred through loss of rather small blocks and mostly in syntenic regions between at least one of the symbionts and present-day E. coli.

Conclusion: At both ancient and recent stages of symbiosis evolution, gene loss was at least partially influenced by selection, highly conserved genes being retained more readily than lowly conserved genes: although losses might result from drift due to the bottlenecking of endosymbiontic populations, we demonstrated that purifying selection also acted by retaining genes of greater selective importance.},

@article{Wang:2006il,
	Abstract = {Pseudogenization is a widespread phenomenon in genome evolution, and it has been proposed to serve as an engine of evolutionary change, especially during human origins (the "less-is-more'' hypothesis). However, there has been no comprehensive analysis of human-specific pseudogenes. Furthermore, it is unclear whether pseudogenization itself can be selectively favored and thus play an active role in human evolution. Here we conduct a comparative genomic analysis and a literature survey to identify 80 nonprocessed pseudogenes that were inactivated in the human lineage after its separation from the chimpanzee lineage. Many functions are involved among these genes, with chemoreception and immune response being outstandingly overrepresented, suggesting potential species-specific features in these aspects of human physiology. To explore the possibility of adaptive pseudogenization, we focus on CASPASE12, a cysteinyl aspartate proteinase participating in inflammatory and innate immune response to endotoxins. We provide population genetic evidence that the nearly complete fixation of a null allele at CASPASE12 has been driven by positive selection, probably because the null allele confers protection from severe sepsis. We estimate that the selective advantage of the null allele is about 0.9\% and the pseudogenization started shortly before the out-of-Africa migration of modern humans. Interestingly, two other genes related to sepsis were also pseudogenized in humans, possibly by selection. These adaptive gene losses might have occurred because of changes in our environment or genetic background that altered the threat from or response to sepsis. The identification and analysis of human-specific pseudogenes open the door for understanding the roles of gene losses in human origins, and the demonstration that gene loss itself can be adaptive supports and extends the "less-is-more'' hypothesis.},

	Abstract = {Background: Obligate pathogenic bacteria lose more genes relative to facultative pathogens, which, in turn, lose more genes than free-living bacteria. It was suggested that the increased gene loss in obligate pathogens may be due to a reduction in the effectiveness of purifying selection. Less attention has been given to the causes of increased gene loss in facultative pathogens.

Results: We examined in detail the rate of gene loss in two groups of facultative pathogenic bacteria: pathogenic Escherichia coli, and Shigella. We show that Shigella strains are losing genes at an accelerated rate relative to pathogenic E. coli. We demonstrate that a genome-wide reduction in the effectiveness of selection contributes to the observed increase in the rate of gene loss in Shigella.

Conclusion: When compared with their closely related pathogenic E. coli relatives, the more niche-limited Shigella strains appear to be losing genes at a significantly accelerated rate. A genome-wide reduction in the effectiveness of purifying selection plays a role in creating this observed difference. Our results demonstrate that differences in the effectiveness of selection contribute to differences in rate of gene loss in facultative pathogenic bacteria. We discuss how the lifestyle and pathogenicity of Shigella may alter the effectiveness of selection, thus influencing the rate of gene loss.},

	Abstract = {Lineage-specific gene loss, to a large extent, accounts for the differences in gene repertoires between genomes, particularly among eukaryotes. We derived a parsimonious scenario of gene losses for eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) from seven complete eukaryotic genomes. The scenario involves substantial gene loss in fungi, nematodes, and insects. Based on this evolutionary scenario and estimates of the divergence times between major eukaryotic phyla, we introduce a numerical measure, the propensity for gene loss (PGL). We explore the connection among the propensity of a gene to be lost in evolution (PGL value), protein sequence divergence, the effect of gene knockout on fitness, the number of protein-protein interactions, and expression level for the genes in KOGs. Significant correlations between PGL and each of these variables were detected. Genes that have a lower propensity to be lost in eukaryotic evolution accumulate fewer substitutions in their protein sequences and tend to be essential for the organism viability, tend to be highly expressed, and have many interaction partners. The dependence between PGL and gene dispensability and interactivity is much stronger than that for sequence evolution rate. Thus, propensity of a gene to be lost during evolution seems to be a direct reflection of its biological importance.},

	Abstract = {The origin of new genes is extremely important to evolutionary innovation. Most new genes arise from existing genes through duplication or recombination. The origin of new genes from noncoding DNA is extremely rare, and very few eukaryotic examples are known. We present evidence for the de novo origin of at least three human protein-coding genes since the divergence with chimp. Each of these genes has no protein-coding homologs in any other genome, but is supported by evidence from expression and, importantly, proteomics data. The absence of these genes in chimp and macaque cannot be explained by sequencing gaps or annotation error. High-quality sequence data indicate that these loci are noncoding DNA in other primates. Furthermore, chimp, gorilla, gibbon, and macaque share the same disabling sequence difference, supporting the inference that the ancestral sequence was noncoding over the alternative possibility of parallel gene inactivation in multiple primate lineages. The genes are not well characterized, but interestingly, one of them was first identified as an up-regulated gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. This is the first evidence for entirely novel human-specific protein-coding genes originating from ancestrally noncoding sequences. We estimate that 0.075\% of human genes may have originated through this mechanism leading to a total expectation of 18 such cases in a genome of 24,000 protein-coding genes.},

	Abstract = {Genome annotation produces a considerable number of putative proteins lacking sequence similarity to known proteins. These are referred to as "orphans." The proportion of orphan genes varies among genomes, and is independent of genome size. In the present study, we show that the proportion of orphan genes roughly correlates with the isolation index of organisms (IIO), an indicator introduced in the present study, which represents the degree of isolation of a given genome as measured by sequence similarity. However, there are outlier genomes with respect to the linear correlation, consisting of those genomes that may contain excess amounts of orphan genes. Comparisons of genome sequences among closely related strains revealed that some of the annotated genes are not conserved, suggesting that they are ORFs occurring by chance. Exclusion of these non-conserved ORFs within closely related genomes improved the correlation between the proportion of orphan genes and the IIO values. Assuming that the correlation holds in general, this relationship was used to estimate the number of "authentic" orphan genes in a genome. Using this definition of authentic orphan genes, the anomalies arising from over-assignments, e.g., the percentages of structural annotations, were corrected for 16 genomes, including those of five archaea.},

@article{Bridgham:2008pi,
	Abstract = {Gene duplication is the predominant mechanism for the evolution of new genes. Major existing models of this process assume that duplicate genes are redundant; degenerative mutations in one copy can therefore accumulate close to neutrally, usually leading to loss from the genome. When gene products dimerize or interact with other molecules for their functions, however, degenerative mutations in one copy may produce repressor alleles that inhibit the function of the other and are therefore exposed to selection. Here, we describe the evolution of a duplicate repressor by simple degenerative mutations in the steroid hormone receptors (SRs), a biologically crucial vertebrate gene family. We isolated and characterized the SRs of the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae, which diverged from other chordates just after duplication of the ancestral SR. The B. floridae genome contains two SRs: BfER, an ortholog of the vertebrate estrogen receptors, and BfSR, an ortholog of the vertebrate receptors for androgens, progestins, and corticosteroids. BfSR is specifically activated by estrogens and recognizes estrogen response elements (EREs) in DNA; BfER does not activate transcription in response to steroid hormones but binds EREs, where it competitively represses BfSR. The two genes are partially coexpressed, particularly in ovary and testis, suggesting an ancient role in germ cell development. These results corroborate previous findings that the ancestral steroid receptor was estrogen-sensitive and indicate that, after duplication, BfSR retained the ancestral function, while BfER evolved the capacity to negatively regulate BfSR. Either of two historical mutations that occurred during BfER evolution is sufficient to generate a competitive repressor. Our findings suggest that after duplication of genes whose functions depend on specific molecular interactions, high-probability degenerative mutations can yield novel functions, which are then exposed to positive or negative selection; in either case, the probability of neofunctionalization relative to gene loss is increased compared to existing models.},

	Abstract = {The ubiquity of multigene families is evidence for the frequent occurrence of gene duplication, but the origin of multigene families from a single gene remains a little-studied aspect of genome evolution. Although it is clear that a duplication can arise and become fixed in a population purely by random genetic drift and that the rate of fixation is accelerated if the duplication is directly advantageous, the nature of gene duplication suggests that other factors may influence the fate of a novel duplication. In the face of disadvantageous loss-of-function mutations, duplication of a functional gene may provide a buffer against such mutations. Here the conditions for invasion of a rare duplication starting from a mutation-selection balance are derived with formal population genetic models in both haploids and diploids. Recurrent duplication protects the duplicated chromosome from loss and can be very effective in increasing its frequency in a population. In the absence of recurrent duplication, one might suppose that a duplication would be favored by natural selection because it can mask the effects of deleterious mutations. However, the models show that a duplication can invade only if it provides a direct advantage to the organism. This result is closely related to recent theoretical work on the evolution of ploidy.},

	Abstract = {The origin of organismal complexity is generally thought to be tightly coupled to the evolution of new gene functions arising subsequent to gene duplication. Under the classical model for the evolution of duplicate genes, one member of the duplicated pair usually degenerates within a few million years by accumulating deleterious mutations, while the other duplicate retains the original function. This model further predicts that on rare occasions, one duplicate may acquire a new adaptive function, resulting in the preservation of both members of the pair, one with the new function and the other retaining the old. However, empirical data suggest that a much greater proportion of gene duplicates is preserved than predicted by the classical model. Here we present a new conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of duplicate genes that may help explain this conundrum. Focusing on the regulatory complexity of eukaryotic genes, we show how complementary degenerative mutations in different regulatory elements of duplicated genes can facilitate the preservation of both duplicates, thereby increasing long-term opportunities for the evolution of new gene functions. The duplication-degeneration-complementation (DDC) model predicts that (1) degenerative mutations in regulatory elements can increase rather than reduce the probability of duplicate gene preservation and (2) the usual mechanism of duplicate gene preservation is the partitioning of ancestral functions rather than the evolution of new functions. We present several examples (including analysis of a new engrailed gene in zebrafish) that appear to be consistent with the DDC model, and we suggest several analytical and experimental approaches for determining whether the complementary loss of gene subfunctions or the acquisition of novel functions are likely to be the primary mechanisms for the preservation of gene duplicates. For a newly duplicated paralog, survival depends on the outcome of the race between entropic decay and chance acquisition of an advantageous regulatory mutation. Sidow 1996(p. 717) On one hand, it may fix an advantageous allele giving it a slightly different, and selectable, function from its original copy. This initial fixation provides substantial protection against future fixation of null mutations, allowing additional mutations to accumulate that refine functional differentiation. Alternatively, a duplicate locus can instead first fix a null allele, becoming a pseudogene. Walsh 1995 (p. 426) Duplicated genes persist only if mutations create new and essential protein functions, an event that is predicted to occur rarely. Nadeau and Sankoff 1997 (p. 1259) Thus overall, with complex metazoans, the major mechanism for retention of ancient gene duplicates would appear to have been the acquisition of novel expression sites for developmental genes, with its accompanying opportunity for new gene roles underlying the progressive extension of development itself.

	Abstract = {Through phylogeny reconstruction we identified 49 genes with a single copy in man, mouse, and chicken, one or two copies in the tetraploid frog Xenopus laevis, and two copies in zebrafish (Danlo rerio). For 22 of these genes, both zebrafish duplicates had orthologs in the pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes). For another 20 of these genes, we found only one pufferfish ortholog but in each case it was more closely related to one of the zebrafish duplicates than to the other. Forty-three pairs of duplicated genes map to 24 of the 25 zebrafish linkage groups but they are not randomly distributed; we identified 10 duplicated regions of the zebrafish genome that each contain between two and five sets of paralogous genes. These phylogeny and synteny data suggest that the common ancestor of zebrafish and pufferfish, a fish that gave rise to similar to22,000 species, experienced a large-scale gene or complete genome duplication event and that the pufferfish has lost many duplicates that the zebrafish has retained.},

	Abstract = {Genomic comparisons provide evidence for ancient genome-wide duplications in a diverse array of animals and plants. We developed a birth-death model to identify evidence for genome duplication in EST data, and applied a mixture model to estimate the age distribution of paralogous pairs identified in EST sets for species representing the basal-most extant flowering plant lineages. We found evidence for episodes of ancient genome-wide duplications in the basal angiosperm lineages including Nuphar advena (yellow water lily: Nymphaeaceae) and the magnoliids Persea americana (avocado: Lauraceae), Liriodendron tulipifera (tulip poplar: Magnoliaceae), and Saruma henryi (Aristolochiaceae). In addition, we detected independent genome duplications in the basal eudicot Eschscholzia californica (California poppy: Papaveraceae) and the basal monocot Acorus americanus (Acoraceae), both of which were distinct from duplications documented for ancestral grass (Poaceae) and core eudicot lineages. Among gymnosperms, we found equivocal evidence for ancient polyploidy in Welwitschia mirabilis (Gnetales) and no evidence for polyploidy in pine, although gymnosperms generally have much larger genomes than the angiosperms investigated. Cross-species sequence divergence estimates suggest that synonymous substitution rates in the basal angiosperms are less than half those previously reported for core eudicots and members of Poaceae. These lower substitution rates permit inference of older duplication events. We hypothesize that evidence of an ancient duplication observed in the Nuphar data may represent a genome duplication in the common ancestor of all or most extant angiosperms, except Amborella.},

@article{Dehal:2005bs,
	Abstract = {The hypothesis that the relatively large and complex vertebrate genome was created by two ancient, whole genome duplications has been hotly debated, but remains unresolved. We reconstructed the evolutionary relationships of all gene families from the complete gene sets of a tunicate, fish, mouse, and human, and then determined when each gene duplicated relative to the evolutionary tree of the organisms. We confirmed the results of earlier studies that there remains little signal of these events in numbers of duplicated genes, gene tree topology, or the number of genes per multigene family. However, when we plotted the genomic map positions of only the subset of paralogous genes that were duplicated prior to the fish - tetrapod split, their global physical organization provides unmistakable evidence of two distinct genome duplication events early in vertebrate evolution indicated by clear patterns of four-way paralogous regions covering a large part of the human genome. Our results highlight the potential for these large-scale genomic events to have driven the evolutionary success of the vertebrate lineage.},

	Abstract = {Gene and genome duplications provide a source of genetic material for mutation, drift, and selection to act upon, making new evolutionary opportunities possible. As a result, many have argued that genome duplication is a dominant factor in the evolution of complexity and diversity. However, a clear correlation between a genome duplication event and increased complexity and diversity is not apparent, and there are inconsistencies in the patterns of diversity invoked to support this claim. Interestingly, several estimates of genome duplication events in vertebrates are preceded by multiple extinct lineages, resulting in preduplication gaps in extant taxa. Here we argue that gen(om)e duplication could contribute to reduced risk of extinction via functional redundancy, mutational robustness, increased rates of evolution, and adaptation. The timeline for these processes to unfold would not predict immediate increases in species diversity after the duplication event. Rather, reduced probabilities of extinction would predict a latent period between a genome duplication and its effect on species diversity or complexity. In this paper, we will develop the idea that genome duplication could contribute to species diversity through reduced probability of extinction.},

	Abstract = {Functional modules are considered the primary building blocks of biomolecular systems. Here we study to what extent functional modules behave cohesively across genomes:That is, are functional modules also evolutionary modules? We probe this question by analyzing for a large collection of functional modules the phyletic patterns of their genes across 110 genomes. The majority of functional modules display limited evolutionary modularity. This result confirms certain comparative genome analyses, but is in contrast to implicit assumptions in the systems analysis of functional genomics data. We show that this apparent interspecies flexibility in the organization of functional modules depends more on functional differentiation within orthologous groups of genes, than on noise in the functional module definitions. When filtering out these sources of nonmodularity, even though very few functional modules behave perfectly modular in evolution, about half behave at least significantly more modular than a random set of genes. There are substantial differences in the evolutionary modularity between individual functional modules as well as between collections of functional modules, partly corresponding to conceptual differences in the functional module definition, which make comparisons between functional module collections biologically difficult to interpret. Analysis within one collection does not suffer from such differences, and we show that within the EcoCyc metabolic pathway database, biosynthetic pathways are evolutionarily more modular than catabolic pathways.},

@article{Scott:1984oq,
	Abstract = {Genes that regulate the development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster exist as tightly linked clusters in at least two cases. These clusters, the bithorax complex (BX-C) and the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C), both contain multiple homoeotic loci: mutations in each locus cause a transformation of one part of the fly into another. Several repetitive DNA sequences, including at least one transposon, were mapped in the ANT-C. DNA from the 3' exon of Antennapedia (Antp), a homoeotic locus in the ANT-C, hybridized weakly to DNA from the 3' exon of Ultrabithorax (Ubx), a homoeotic locus in the BX-C. DNA from each of these 3' exons also hybridized weakly to DNA from the fushi tarazu locus of the ANT-C. The fushi tarazu (ftz) locus controls the number and differentiation of segments in the developing embryo. Sequence analysis of the cross-hybridizing DNA from the three loci revealed the conservation of predicted amino acid sequences derived from coding parts of the genes. This suggests that two homoeotic loci and a "segment-deficient" locus encode protein products with partially shared structures and that the three loci may be evolutionarily and functionally related.},

	Abstract = {Homoeotic genes in Drosophila melanogaster are active in spatially restricted metameric domains and control the morphogenesis of segment-specific features such as legs or wings within these domains. They exert their function, according to the 'selector gene' hypothesis, by regulating the expression of subordinate genes. Homoeotic genes also control their own expression and the expression of each other. The proteins encoded by these genes contain a domain, called a homoeodomain, that is strongly conserved, and that shows homologies to proteins that bind DNA and regulate transcription. Homoeoproteins have been shown to bind specific DNA sequences. We show here that the Drosophila homoeotic genes Ultrabithorax (Ubx) and Abdominal-B (Abd-B) code for proteins that are capable of activating transcription of reporter genes linked to specific cis-regulatory target sequences in transfected mammalian cells. Their activity, as well as their target specificity, is similar to that of a mammalian lymphoid-specific octamer transcription factor, OTF-2, which was recently found to contain a homoeodomain.},

	Abstract = {Hox genes are known to specify spatial identities along the anterior-posterior axis during embryogenesis. In vertebrates and most other deuterostomes, they are arranged in sets of uninterrupted clusters on chromosomes, and are in most cases expressed in a "colinear" fashion, in which genes closer to the 3-end of the Hox clusters are expressed earlier and more anteriorly and genes close to the 5-end of the clusters later and more posteriorly. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of how Hox gene clusters have been modified from basal lineages of deuterostomes to diverse taxa of vertebrates. Our parsimony reconstruction of Hox cluster architecture at various stages of vertebrate evolution highlights that the variation in Hox cluster structures among jawed vertebrates is mostly due to secondary lineage-specific gene losses and an additional genome duplication that occurred in the actinopterygian stem lineage, the teleost-specific genome duplication (TSGD).},

@article{Ogishima:2007bh,
	Abstract = {Hox cluster has key roles in regulating the patterning of the antero-posterior axis in a metazoan embryo. It consists of the anterior, central and posterior genes; the central genes have been identified only in bilaterians, but not in cnidarians, and are responsible for archiving morphological complexity in bilaterian development. However, their evolutionary history has not been revealed, that is, there has been a "missing link". Here we show the evolutionary history of Hox clusters of 18 bilaterians and 2 cnidarians by using a new method, "motif-based reconstruction", examining the gain/loss processes of evolutionarily conserved sequences, "motifs", outside the homeodomain. We successfully identified the missing link in the evolution of Hox clusters between the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor and the bilaterians as the ancestor of the central genes, which we call the proto-central gene. Exploring the correspondent gene with the proto-central gene, we found that one of the acoela Hox genes has the same motif repertory as that of the proto-central gene. This interesting finding suggests that the acoela Hox cluster corresponds with the missing link in the evolution of the Hox cluster between the cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor and the bilaterians. Our findings suggested that motif gains/diversifications led to the explosive diversity of the bilaterian body plan.},

@article{Lanfear:2008qf,
	Abstract = {The Hox genes encode transcription factors that play vital roles in the anterior-posterior patterning of all bilaterian phyla studied to date. Additionally, the gain of Hox genes by duplication has been widely implicated as a driving force in the evolution of animal body plans. Because of this, reconstructing the evolution of the Hox cluster has been the focus of intense research interest. It has been commonly assumed that an ancestral four-gene ProtoHox cluster was duplicated early in animal evolution to give rise to the Hox and ParaHox clusters. However, this hypothesis has recently been called into question, and a number of alternative hypotheses of Hox and ParaHox gene evolution have been proposed. Here, we present the first statistical comparisons of current hypotheses of Hox and ParaHox gene evolution. We use two statistical methods that represent two different approaches to the treatment of phylogenetic uncertainty. In the first method, we estimate the maximum-likelihood tree for each hypothesis and compare these trees to one another using a parametric bootstrapping approach. In the second method, we use Bayesian phylogenetics to estimate the posterior distribution of trees, then we calculate the support for each hypothesis from this distribution. The results of both methods are largely congruent. We find that we are able to reject five out of the eight current hypotheses of Hox and ParaHox gene evolution that we consider. We conclude that the ProtoHox cluster is likely to have contained either three or four genes but that there is insufficient phylogenetic signal in the homeodomains to distinguish between these alternatives.},

	Abstract = {Modules can be defined as quasi-autonomous units that are connected loosely with each other within a system. A need for the concept of modularity has emerged as we deal with evolving organisms in evolutionary developmental research, especially because it is unknown how genes are associated with anatomical patterns. One of the strategies to link genotypes with phenotypes could be to relate developmental modules with morphological ones. To do this, it is fundamental to grasp the context in which certain anatomical units and developmental processes are associated with each other specifically. By identifying morphological modularities as units recognized by some categories of general homology as established by comparative anatomy, it becomes possible to identify developmental modules whose genetic components exhibit coextensive expressions. This permits us to distinguish the evolutionary modification in which the identical morphological module simply alters its shape for adaptation, without being decoupled from the functioning gene network ('coupled modularities'), from the evolution of novelty that involves a heterotopic shift between the anatomical and developmental modules. Using this formulation, it becomes possible, within the realm of Geoffroy's homologous networks, to reduce morphological homologies to developmental mechanistic terms by dissociating certain classes of modules that are often associated with actual shapes and functions.},

@article{Singh:2008ly,
	Abstract = {Responses to extracellular stress directly confer survival fitness by means of complex regulatory networks. Despite their complexity, the networks must be evolvable because of changing ecological and environmental pressures. Although the regulatory networks underlying stress responses are characterized extensively, their mechanism of evolution remains poorly understood. Here, we examine the evolution of three candidate stress response networks (chemotaxis, competence for DNA uptake, and endospore formation) by analyzing their phylogenetic distribution across several hundred diverse bacterial and archaeal lineages. We report that genes in the chemotaxis and sporulation networks group into well defined evolutionary modules with distinct functions, phenotypes, and substitution rates as compared with control sets of randomly chosen genes. The evolutionary modules vary in both number and cohesiveness among the three pathways. Chemotaxis has five coherent modules whose distribution among species shows a clear pattern of interdependence and rewiring. Sporulation, by contrast, is nearly monolithic and seems to be inherited vertically, with three weak modules constituting early and late stages of the pathway. Competence does not seem to exhibit well defined modules either at or below the pathway level. Many of the detected modules are better understood in engineering terms than in protein functional terms, as we demonstrate using a control-based ontology that classifies gene function according to roles such as "sensor," "regulator," and "actuator." Moreover, we show that combinations of the modules predict phenotype, yet surprisingly do not necessarily correlate with phylogenetic inheritance. The architectures of these three pathways are therefore emblematic of different modes and constraints on evolution.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cellular metabolism is a fundamental biological system consisting of myriads of enzymatic reactions that together fulfill the basic requirements of life. The recent availability of vast amounts of sequence data from diverse sets of organisms provides an opportunity to systematically examine metabolism from a comparative perspective. Here we supplement existing genome and protein resources with partial genome datasets derived from 193 eukaryotes to present a comprehensive survey of the conservation of metabolism across 26 taxa representing the three domains of life. RESULTS: In general, metabolic enzymes are highly conserved. However, organizing these enzymes within the context of functional pathways revealed a spectrum of conservation from those that are highly conserved (for example, carbohydrate, energy, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism enzymes) to those specific to individual taxa (for example, those involved in glycan metabolism and secondary metabolite pathways). Applying a novel co-conservation analysis, KEGG defined pathways did not generally display evolutionary coherence. Instead, such modularity appears restricted to smaller subsets of enzymes. Expanding analyses to a global metabolic network revealed a highly conserved, but nonetheless flexible, 'core' of enzymes largely involved in multiple reactions across different pathways. Enzymes and pathways associated with the periphery of this network were less well conserved and associated with taxon-specific innovations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to an emerging picture in which a core of enzyme activities involving amino acid, energy, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism have evolved to provide the basic functions required for life. However, the precise complement of enzymes associated within this core for each species is flexible.},

Through systematic tagging of open reading frames (ORFs), the majority of complexes were purified several times, suggesting screen saturation. The richness of the data set enabled a de novo characterization of the composition and organization of the cellular machinery. The ensemble of cellular proteins partitions into 491 complexes, of which 257 are novel, that differentially combine with additional attachment proteins or protein modules to enable a diversification of potential functions. Support for this modular organization of the proteome comes from integration with available data on expression, localization, function, evolutionary conservation, protein structure and binary interactions. This study provides the largest collection of physically determined eukaryotic cellular machines so far and a platform for biological data integration and modelling.},

	Abstract = {Multicellularity appeared early and repeatedly in life's history; its instantiations presumably required the confluence of environmental, ecological, and genetic factors. Comparisons of several independently evolved pairs of multicellular and unicellular relatives indicate that transitions to multicellularity are typically associated with increases in the numbers of genes involved in cell differentiation, cell-cell communication, and adhesion. Further examination of the DNA record suggests that these increases in gene complexity are the product of evolutionary innovation, tinkering, and expansion of genetic material. Arguably, the most decisive multicellular transition was the emergence of animals. Decades of developmental work have demarcated the genetic toolkit for animal multicellularity, a select set of a few hundred genes from a few dozen gene families involved in adhesion, communication, and differentiation. Examination of the DNA records of the earliest-branching animal phyla and their closest protist relatives has begun to shed light on the origins and assembly of this toolkit. Emerging data favor a model of gradual assembly, with components originating and diversifying at different time points prior to or shortly after the origin of animals.},

	Abstract = {The differentiation of both gene expression and protein function is thought to be important as a mechanism of the functionalization of duplicate genes. However, it has not been addressed whether expression or protein divergence of duplicate genes is greater in those genes that have undergone functionalization compared with those that have not. We examined a total of 492 paralogous gene pairs associated with morphological diversification in a plant model organism (Arabidopsis thaliana). Classifying these paralogous gene pairs into high, low, and no morphological diversification groups, based on knock-out data, we found that the divergence rate of both gene expression and protein sequences were significantly higher in either high or low morphological diversification groups compared with those in the no morphological diversification group. These results strongly suggest that the divergence of both expression and protein sequence are important sources for morphological diversification of duplicate genes. Although both mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, our analysis suggested that changes of expression pattern play the minor role (33\%-41\%) and that changes of protein sequence play the major role (59\%-67\%) in morphological diversification. Finally, we examined to what extent duplicate genes are associated with expression or protein divergence exerting morphological diversification at the whole-genome level. Interestingly, duplicate genes randomly chosen from A. thaliana had not experienced expression or protein divergence that resulted in morphological diversification. These results indicate that most duplicate genes have experienced minor functionalization.},

	Abstract = {Whole-genome sequences from the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens and the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis have confirmed results from comparative evolutionary developmental studies that much of the developmental toolkit once thought to be characteristic of bilaterians appeared much earlier in the evolution of animals. The diversity of transcription factors and signalling pathway genes in animals with a limited number of cell types and a restricted developmental repertoire is puzzling, particularly in light of claims that such highly conserved elements among bilaterians provide evidence of a morphologically complex protostome-deuterostome ancestor. Here, I explore the early origination of elements of what became the bilaterian toolkit, and suggest that placozoans and cnidarians represent a depauperate residue of a once more diverse assemblage of early animals, some of which may be represented in the Ediacaran fauna (c. 585-542 Myr ago).},

	Abstract = {Identification of novel targets for the development of more effective antimalarial drugs and vaccines is a primary goal of the Plasmodium genome project. However, deciding which gene products are ideal drug/vaccine targets remains a difficult task. Currently, a systematic disruption of every single gene in Plasmodium is technically challenging. Hence, we have developed a computational approach to prioritize potential targets. A pathway/genome database (PGDB) integrates pathway information with information about the complete genome of an organism. We have constructed PlasmoCyc, a PGDB for Plasmodium falciparum 3D7, using its annotated genomic sequence. In addition to the annotations provided in the genome database, we add 956 additional annotations to proteins annotated as "hypothetical" using the GeneQuiz annotation system. We apply a novel computational algorithm to PlasmoCyc to identify 216 "chokepoint enzymes." All three clinically validated drug targets are chokepoint enzymes. A total of 87.5\% of proposed drug targets with biological evidence in the literature are chokepoint reactions. Therefore, identifying chokepoint enzymes represents one systematic way to identify potential metabolic drug targets.},

We found that two proteins tend to interact with each other if they are in the same or similar categories, but tended to avoid each other otherwise, and that network evolution mirrors the universal tree of life. These observations suggest synergistic selection during network evolution and provide insights into the hierarchical modularity of cellular networks.},

@article{YANG:1994ly,
	Abstract = {Two approximate methods are proposed for maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation, which allow variable rates of substitution across nucleotide sites. Three data sets with quite different characteristics were analyzed to examine empirically the performance of these methods. The first, called the ''discrete gamma model,'' uses several categories of rates to approximate the gamma distribution, with equal probability for each category. The mean of each category is used to represent all the rates falling in the category. The performance of this method is found to be quite good, and four such categories appear to be sufficient to produce both an optimum, or near-optimum fit by the model to the data, and also an acceptable approximation to the continuous distribution. The second method, called ''fixed-rates model,'' classifies sites into several classes according to their rates predicted assuming the star tree. Sites in different classes are then assumed to be evolving at these fixed rates when other tree topologies are evaluated. Analyses of the data sets suggest that this method can produce reasonable results, but it seems to share some properties of a least-squares pairwise comparison; for example, interior branch lengths in nonbest trees are often found to be zero. The computational requirements of the two methods are comparable to that of Felsenstein's (1981, J Mol Evol 17:368-376) model, which assumes a single rate for all the sites.},

@article{Nabholz:2008zr,
	Abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the most popular marker of molecular diversity in animals, primarily because of its elevated mutation rate. After >20 years of intensive usage, the extent of mitochondrial evolutionary rate variations across species, their practical consequences on sequence analysis methods, and the ultimate reasons for mtDNA hypermutability are still largely unresolved issues. Using an extensive cytochrome b data set, fossil data, and taking advantage of the decoupled dynamics of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions, we measure the lineage-specific mitochondrial mutation rate across 1,696 mammalian species and compare it with the nuclear rate. We report an unexpected 2 orders of magnitude mitochondrial mutation rate variation between lineages: cytochrome b third codon positions are renewed every 1-2 Myr, in average, in the fastest evolving mammals, whereas it takes >100 Myr in slow-evolving lineages. This result has obvious implications in the fields of molecular phylogeny, molecular dating, and population genetics. Variations of mitochondrial substitution rate across species are partly explained by body mass, longevity, and age of female sexual maturity. The classical metabolic rate and generation time hypothesis, however, do not fully explain the observed patterns, especially a stronger effect of longevity in long-lived than in short-lived species. We propose that natural selection tends to decrease the mitochondrial mutation rate in long-lived species, in agreement with the mitochondrial theory of aging.},

	Abstract = {Heterogeneous DNA substitution rates were found in the 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and external transcribed spacer (ETS) regions of Sidalcea (Malvaceae), a putatively young genus of annuals and perennials. The majority of comparisons revealed that the annual species had significantly higher molecular evolutionary rates than the perennials, whereas rates were consistently homogenous between obligate annual species. These findings led us to conclude that generation time or possibly another biological factor distinguishing annuals and perennials has influenced rates of molecular evolution in Sidalcea. The congruence of relative-rate test results across both spacer regions reinforced the association between life history and rate of rDNA evolution across lineages of checker mallows. Evolutionary rate variation within perennials mainly involved three basally divergent lineages. The faster rate in one lineage, Sidalcea stipularis, compared with other perennials may be the result of genetic drift in the only known, small, population. The other two basally divergent lineages had slower evolutionary rates compared with the remaining perennials; possible explanations for these differences include rate-reducing effects of a suffrutescent (rather than herbaceous) habit and seed dormancy.},

	Abstract = {Rate constancy of DNA sequence evolution was examined for three species of Drosophila, using two samples: the published sequences of eight genes from regions of the normal recombination rates and new data of the four AS-C (ac, sc, l'sc and ase) and ct genes. The AS-C and ci genes were chosen because these genes are located in the regions of very reduced recombination in Drosophila melanogaster and their locations remain unchanged throughout the entire lineages involved, yielding less effect of ancestral polymorphism in the study of rate constancy. The synonymous substitution pattern of the three lineages was found to be erratic in both samples. The dispersion index for replacement substitution was relatively high for the per, G6pd and ac genes. A significant heterogeneity was found in the number of synonymous substitutions in the three lineages between the two samples of genes with different recombination rates. This is partly due to a lack of the lineage effect in the D. melanogaster and Drosophila simulans lineages in the AS-C and ci genes in contrast to AKASHI'S observation of genes in regions of normal recombination. The higher codon bias in Drosophila yakuba as compared with D. melanogaster and D. simulans was observed in the four AS-C genes, which suggests change(s) in action of natural selection involved in codon usage on these genes. Fluctuating selection intensity may also be responsible for the observed locus-lineage interaction effects in synonymous substitution.},

	Abstract = {Genetic changes contributing to phenotypic differences within or between species have been identified for a handful of traits, but the relationship between alleles underlying intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence is largely unknown. We found that noncoding changes in the tan gene, as well as changes linked to the ebony gene, contribute to pigmentation divergence between closely related Drosophila species. Moreover, we found that alleles linked to tan and ebony fixed in one Drosophila species also contribute to variation within another species, and that multiple genotypes underlie similar phenotypes even within the same population. These alleles appear to predate speciation, which suggests that standing genetic variation present in the common ancestor gave rise to both intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence.},

For this purpose, we, the Genome 10K Community of Scientists (G10KCOS), will assemble and allocate a biospecimen collection of some 16,203 representative vertebrate species spanning evolutionary diversity across living mammals, birds, nonavian reptiles, amphibians, and fishes (ca. 60,000 living species). In this proposal, we present precise counts for these 16,203 individual species with specimens presently tagged and stipulated for DNA sequencing by the G10KCOS. DNA sequencing has ushered in a new era of investigation in the biological sciences, allowing us to embark for the first time on a truly comprehensive study of vertebrate evolution, the results of which will touch nearly every aspect of vertebrate biological enquiry.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new method for approximate Bayesian statistical inference on the basis of summary statistics. The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

	Abstract = {Most drosophilid species can be classified either as temperate or tropical. Adults of species were submitted to a cold treatment (0 degrees C) and then brought back to ambient temperature. They generally exhibited a chill coma and the time needed to recover was measured. We found in a set of 26 temperate species that recovery was rapid (average 1.8 min, range 0.15-4.9). In contrast, a long recovery time (average 56 min, range 24-120) was observed for 48 tropical species. A few species, like Drosophila melanogaster, are cosmopolitan and can proliferate under temperate and tropical climates. In 9 of 10 such species, slight genetic differences were found: a shorter recovery in temperate than in tropical populations. Comparing physiological data to phylogeny suggests that chill-coma tolerance has been a recurrent adaptation that is selected for in cold climates but tends to disappear under a permanently warm environment. This major climatic adaptation, evidenced in drosophilids, seems to occur in other insect groups also.},

	Abstract = {Genetic background effects contribute to the phenotypic consequences of mutations and are pervasive across all domains of life that have been examined, yet little is known about how they modify genetic systems. In part this is due to the lack of tractable model systems that have been explicitly developed to study the genetic and evolutionary consequences of background effects. In this study we demonstrate that phenotypic expressivity of the scalloped(E3) (sd(E3)) mutation of Drosophila melanogaster is background dependent and is the result of at least one major modifier segregating between two standard lab wild-type strains. We provide evidence that at least one of the modifiers is linked to the vestigial region and demonstrate that the background effects modify the spatial distribution of known sd target genes in a genotype-dependent manner. In addition, microarrays were used to examine the consequences of genetic background effects on the global transcriptome. Expression differences between wild-type strains were found to be as large as or larger than the effects of mutations with substantial phenotypic effects, and expression differences between wild type and mutant varied significantly between genetic backgrounds. Significantly, we demonstrate that the epistatic interaction between sd(E3) and an optomotor blind mutation is background dependent. The results are discussed within the context of developing a complex but more realistic view of the consequences of genetic background effects with respect to mutational analysis and studies of epistasis and cryptic genetic variation segregating in natural populations.},

	Abstract = {Hairless was identified as antagonist in the Notch signaling pathway based on genetic interactions. Molecularly, Hairless inhibits Notch target gene activation by directly binding to the Notch signal transducer Su(H). Additional functional domains apart from the Su(H) binding domain, however, suggest additional roles for the Hairless protein. To further our understanding of Hairless functions, we have performed a genetic screen for modifiers of a rough eye phenotype caused by overexpression of Hairless during eye development. A number of enhancers were identified that comprise mutations in components of Notch- and EGFR-signaling pathways, some unknown genes and the gene rugose. Mutant alleles of rugose display manifold genetic interactions with mutants in Notch and EGFR signaling pathway components. Accordingly, the rugose eye phenotype is rescued by Hairless and enhanced by Delta. Molecularly, interactions might occur at the protein level because rugose appears not to be a direct transcriptional target of Notch.},

Mutations at the rugose locus (rg) result in a rough eye phenotype due to a disorganized retina and aberrant cone cell differentiation, which leads to reduction or complete loss of cone cells. The cone cell phenotype is sensitive to the level of rugose gene function. Molecular analyses show that rugose encodes a Drosophila A kinase anchor protein (DAKAP 550). Genetic interaction studies show that rugose interacts with the components of the EGFR- and Notch-mediated signaling pathways. Our results suggest that rg is required for correct retinal pattern formation and may function in cell fate determination through its interactions with the EGFR and Notch signaling pathways.},

	Abstract = {The proportion of amino acid substitutions driven by adaptive evolution can potentially be estimated from polymorphism and divergence data by an extension of the McDonald-Kreitman test. We have developed a maximum-likelihood method to do this and have applied our method to several data sets from three Drosophila species: D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. yakuba. The estimated number of adaptive substitutions per codon is not uniformly distributed among genes, but follows a leptokurtic distribution. However, the proportion of amino acid substitutions fixed by adaptive evolution seems to be remarkably constant across the genome (i.e., the proportion of amino acid substitutions that are adaptive appears to be the same in fast-evolving and slow-evolving genes; fast-evolving genes have higher numbers of both adaptive and neutral substitutions). Our estimates do not seem to be significantly biased by selection on synonymous codon use or by the assumption of independence among sites. Nevertheless, an accurate estimate is hampered by the existence of slightly deleterious mutations and variations in effective population size. The analysis of several Drosophila data sets suggests that approximately 25\% +/- 20\% of amino acid substitutions were driven by positive selection in the divergence between D. simulans and D. yakuba.},

Evidence has accumulated over the last decade that adaptive evolution does occur at the protein level, but it has remained unclear how prevalent adaptive evolution is. Here we present a simple method by which the number of adaptive substitutions can be estimated and apply it to data from Drosophila simulans and D. yakuba. We estimate that 45\% of all amino-acid substitutions have been fixed by natural selection, and that on average one adaptive substitution occurs every 45 years in these species.},

Instead of assuming a population of constant size, as in most of the previous work on the Y chromosome, we consider a model which permits a period of recent population growth. We show that for most of the populations in our sample this model fits the data far better than a model with no growth. We estimate the demographic parameters of this model for each population and also the time to the most recent common ancestor. Since there is some uncertainty about the details of the microsatellite mutation process, we consider several plausible mutation schemes and estimate the variance in mutation size simultaneously with the demographic parameters of interest. Our finding of a recent common ancestor (probably in the last 120,000 years), coupled with a strong signal of demographic expansion in all populations, suggests either a recent human expansion from a small ancestral population, or natural selection acting on the Y chromosome.},

This understanding is making possible tests for balancing selection using molecular evolutionary approaches. Such tests do not necessarily require knowledge of the functional types of the different alleles at a locus, but such information, as well as information about the geographic distribution of alleles and markers near the genes, can potentially help towards understanding what form of balancing selection is acting, and how long alleles have been maintained.},

Ninety-eight of approximately 4750 sites are segregating in the sample, 36 in the 5' flanking region, 38 in Adh and 24 in Adh-dup. Several methods are presented to test whether the patterns and levels of polymorphism are consistent with neutral molecular evolution. The analysis of within- and between-species polymorphism indicates that the region is evolving in a nonneutral and complex fashion. A graphical analysis of the data provides support for a hypothesized balanced polymorphism at or near position 1490, site of the amino acid replacement difference between Adhf and Adhs. The Adh-dup locus is less polymorphic than Adh and all 24 of its polymorphisms occur at low frequency--suggestive of a recent selective substitution in the Adh-dup region. Adhs alleles form two distinct evolutionary lineages that differ one from another at a total of nineteen sites in the Adh and Adh-dup loci. The polymorphisms are in complete linkage disequilibrium. A recombination experiment failed to find evidence for recombination suppression between the two allelic classes. Two hypotheses are presented to account for the widespread distribution of the two divergent lineages in natural populations. Natural selection appears to have played an important role in governing the overall patterns of nucleotide variation across the two-gene region.},

	Abstract = {Certain major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) loci are highly polymorphic, and the mechanism of maintenance of this polymorphism remains controversial. Recent studies of the pattern of nucleotide substitution at MHC loci have produced strong evidence that this polymorphism is maintained mainly by positive Darwinian selection that operates on the antigen recognition site (ARS) of the MHC molecule. The ARS of the class I MHC consists of three subregions: (1) the binding cleft, (2) T-cell-receptor-directed residues, and (3) outward-directed residues. Here we report that the rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution is much higher in the binding cleft than in the other ARS subregions. Furthermore, nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions that result in a change of residue side-chain charge occur significantly more frequently than expected by chance. We conclude that the main target of positive selection on the class I MHC molecules is the binding cleft of the ARS and that this selection acts primarily to promote diversity among alleles with respect to the pattern of residue side-chain charges (charge profile) in the binding cleft. These results provide additional support for the hypothesis that MHC polymorphism is maintained by overdominant selection relating to antigen-binding capacity and thus to disease resistance.},

Although A. thaliana is a selfing weed, the pattern of polymorphism in general agrees with what is expected for a widely distributed, sexually reproducing species. Linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly, within 50 kb. Variation is shared worldwide, although population structure and isolation by distance are evident. The data fail to fit standard neutral models in several ways. There is a genome-wide excess of rare alleles, at least partially due to selection. There is too much variation between genomic regions in the level of polymorphism. The local level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with gene density and positively correlated with segmental duplications. Because the data do not fit theoretical null distributions, attempts to infer natural selection from polymorphism data will require genome-wide surveys of polymorphism in order to identify anomalous regions. Despite this, our data support the utility of A. thaliana as a model for evolutionary functional genomics.},

A significant excess of amino acid polymorphism segregating within this species is localized within the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of RPP13. These results indicate that single alleles of the gene have not swept through the population, but instead, a diverse collection of alleles have been maintained. Transgenic complementation experiments demonstrate functional differences among alleles in their resistance to various pathogen isolates, suggesting that the extreme amino acid polymorphism in RPP13 is maintained through continual reciprocal selection between host and pathogen.},

	Abstract = {Color vision is an important characteristic of primates and, intriguingly, Neotropical monkeys are highly polymorphic for this trait. Recent field studies have challenged the conventional view that trichromatic color vision is more adaptive than dichromatic color vision. No study has investigated the pattern of genetic variation in the long to middle-wavelength sensitive (L-M or red-green) opsin gene as compared to that of other genomic regions (neutral references) in wild populations of New World monkeys to look for the signature of natural selection. Here we report such a study conducted on spider monkeys and capuchin monkeys inhabiting Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. The nucleotide sequence of the L-M opsin gene was more polymorphic than the sequences of the neutral references, although the opsin gene sequences were not more divergent between the two species than were the sequences of the neutral references. In a coalescence simulation that took into account the observed nucleotide diversity of the neutral references, the Tajima's D value of the L-M opsin gene deviated significantly in a positive direction from the expected range. These results are the first to statistically demonstrate balancing selection acting on the polymorphic L-M opsin gene of New World monkeys. Taking the results of behavioral and genetic studies together, the balancing selection we detected may indicate that coexistence of different color vision types in the same population, also characteristic of humans, is adaptive.},

Our results showed that both HCH and PCP at lower concentrations evoked strong hsromega stress gene expression in the larval tissues while endosulfan did not. On the other hand, puffing data revealed that endosulfan at lower doses, induced well-developed puff at the resident site (93D) of the hsromega gene but the transgenic sites (30B in 951-lacZ2 and 44B in 498-lacZ1 strain) did not show any well-developed puff. Regression in hsromega stress gene expression in 951-lacZ2 strain at LC(50) concentrations of HCH and PCP after 48 h was concurrent with extensive tissue damage as evident by trypan blue staining. Similarly, strong hsromega expression was accompanied by insignificant trypan blue staining in the larval tissues of this strain after shorter duration of exposure (2-12 h) to these toxicants. Although endosulfan under similar experimental condition did not induce hsromega, strong trypan blue staining indicated extensive tissue damage after 48 h of exposure. The present study suggests that all the three toxicants pose cytotoxic potential to Drosophila. While protective role of this stress gene was evident at the initial stages of exposure, extensive tissue damage in the later stages of intoxication accompanied by autorepression of hsromega led to larval mortality. The study further suggests that -844bp upstream sequence of the gene is adequate for hsromega inducibility against HCH and PCP but not for endosulfan for which responsive elements may be searched further upstream.},

	Abstract = {Clinal variation in traits often reflects climatic adaptation; in Drosophila melanogaster clinal variation provides an opportunity to link variation in chromosomal inversions, microsatellite loci and various candidate genes to adaptive variation in traits. We undertook association studies with crosses from a single population of D. melanogaster from eastern Australia to investigate the association between genetic markers and traits showing clinal variation. By genotyping parents and phenotyping offspring, we minimized genotyping costs but had the power to detect association between markers and quantitative traits. Consistent with prior studies, we found strong associations between the clinal chromosomal inversion In(3R)Payne and markers within it, as well as among these markers. We also found an association between In(3L)Payne and one marker located within this inversion. Of the five predicted associations between markers and traits, four were detected (increased heat, decreased cold resistance and body size with the heat shock gene hsr-omega S, increased cold resistance with the inversion In(3L)Payne), while one was not detected (heat resistance and the heat shock gene hsp68). In a set of eight exploratory tests, we detected one positive association (between hsp23a and heat resistance) but no associations of heat resistance with alleles at the hsp26, hsp83, Desat 2, alpha-Gpdh, hsp70 loci, while cold resistance was not associated with Frost and Dca loci. These results confirm interactions between hsr-omega and thermal resistance, as well as between In(3L)Payne and cold resistance, but do not provide evidence for associations between thermal responses and alleles at other clinically varying marker genes.},

	Abstract = {Clinal variation has been described in a number of inversions in Drosophila but these clines are often characterized by cytological techniques using small sample sizes, and associations with specific genes are rarely considered. Here we have developed a molecular assay for In(3R)Payne in Drosophila melanogaster from eastern Australia populations. It shows in repeated samples that the inversion cline is very tightly associated with latitude and is almost fixed in tropical populations while relatively rare in temperate populations. This steep cline has shifted in position in the last 20 years. The heat shock gene, hsr-omega, located centrally inside the inversion sequence, shows a different clinal pattern to In(3R)Payne. These results suggest strong ongoing selection on In(3R)Payne over the last 100 years since the colonization of Australia that is partly independent of hsr-omega.},

	Abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster occurs in diverse climatic regions and shows opposing clinal changes in resistance to heat and resistance to cold along a 3000 km latitudinal transect on the eastern coast of Australia. We report here on variation at a polymorphic 8 bp-indel site in the heat shock hsr-omega gene that maps to the right arm of chromosome 3. The frequency of the genetic element marked by the L form of the gene was strongly and positively associated with latitude along this transect, and latitudinal differences in L frequency were robustly associated with latitudinal differences in maximum temperature for the hottest month. On a genetic background mixed for genes from each end of the cline a set of 10 lines was derived, five of which were fixed for the L marker, the absence of In(3R)P and 12 kb of repeats at a second polymorphic site at the 3' end of hsr-omega, and five that were fixed for the S marker, In(3R)P and 15 kb of hsr-omega repeats. For two different measures of heat tolerance S lines outperformed L lines, and for two different measures of cold tolerance L lines outperformed S lines. These data suggest that an element on the right arm of chromosome 3, possibly In(3R)P, confers heat resistance but carries the trade-off of also conferring susceptibility to cold. This element occurs at high frequency near the equator. The alternate element on the other hand, at high frequency at temperate latitudes, confers cold resistance at the cost of heat susceptibility.},

	Abstract = {The hsr-omega gene of Drosophila melanogaster produces RNA products both constitutively and at elevated levels in response to heat stress. A single-nucleotide difference in this gene that has been detected using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) is responsible for an hsr-omegaa/b polymorphism, and selection experiments have indicated an association between the hsr-omegaa allele and susceptibility to heat stress. Since allele frequency estimates for population surveys using PCR and DGGE for single flies would be relatively time-consuming and expensive, we here develop a quantitative competitive-PCR method using mass-grind genomic DNA preparations for this purpose. Geographical and temporal variation of allele frequency at the hsr-omega locus in Australian populations of D. melanogaster are examined. Regular samples from a southern population through a summer season suggested stability of hsr-omegaa frequency. Field populations sampled from a approximately 2,250 km north-south transect along eastern Australia revealed a strong positive association between the frequency of hsr-omegaa and latitude, and marked spatial autocorrelation. Using appropriate analyses, strong association between population differences in hsr-omegaa frequencies and differences in temperature and rainfall measures, after controlling for latitudinal differences, support the idea that the cline in hsr-omegaa frequency may be attributable to some form of climatic selection.},

	Abstract = {Inducible heat shock genes are considered a major component of the molecular mechanisms that confer cellular protection against a variety of environmental stresses, in particular high temperature extremes. We have tested the association between expression of the heat shock RNA gene hsr-omega and thermoresistance by generating thermoresistant lines of Drosophila melanogaster after application of two distinct regimes of laboratory selection. One set of lines was selected for resistance to knockdown by heat stress and the other was similarly selected but before selection a mild heat exposure known to increase resistance (heat hardening) was applied. A cross between resistant and susceptible lines confirmed our earlier observation that increased thermal tolerance cosegregates with allelic variation in the hsr-omega gene. This cosegregating variation is attributed largely to two haplotype groups. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we find evidence for divergent phenotypic responses in the two selection regimes, involving both structural and regulatory changes in hsr-omega. Lines selected after hardening showed increased levels of the cytoplasmic transcript but decreased levels of the nuclear transcript. Lines selected without hardening showed decreased levels of the cytoplasmic transcript. The allelic frequency changes at hsr-omega could not by themselves account for the altered transcription patterns. Our results support the idea that the functional RNA molecules transcribed from hsr-omega are an important and polymorphic regulatory component of an insect thermoresistance phenotype.},

	Abstract = {An 8-bp deletion in the hsr-omega heat-stress gene of Drosophila melanogaster has previously been associated with latitude, and with heat tolerance that decreases with latitude. Here we report a second polymorphic site, at the 3'-end of hsr-omega, at which multiple alleles segregate in natural populations for copy number of a approximately 280 bp tandem repeat. On each of 3 consecutive years (2000, 2001 and 2002) among populations sampled along the Australian eastern coast, repeat number was negatively associated with latitude. Neither altitudinal association was detected in 2002 when five high-altitude sites were included, nor was a robust association detected with local temperature or rainfall measures. Although in a large number of family lines, derived from a population located centrally in the latitudinal transect, no association between hsr-omega repeat number and heat tolerance occurred, a negative association of repeat number with cold tolerance was detected. As cold tolerance also exhibits latitudinal clines we examined a set of cold-tolerant populations derived by selection and found both reduced repeat number and low constitutive levels of the omega-n repeat-bearing transcript. In a sample from the central population, linkage disequilibrium was measured between repeat number and linked markers that also cline latitudinally. However, such disequilibrium could not account for the cline in repeat number or tolerance associations. Finally, during adult recovery from cold exposure a large increase occurred in tissue levels of the omega-c transcript. Together these data suggest that a latitudinal cline in hsr-omega repeat number influences cold-tolerance variation in this species.},

	Abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster shows clinal variation along latitudinal transects on multiple continents for several phenotypes, allozyme variants, sequence variants, and chromosome inversions. Previous investigation suggests that many such clines are due to spatially varying selection rather than demographic history, but the genomic extent of such selection is unknown. To map differentiation throughout the genome, we hybridized DNA from temperate and subtropical populations to Affymetrix tiling arrays. The dense genomic sampling of variants and low level of linkage disequilibrium in D. melanogaster enabled identification of many small, differentiated regions. Many regions are differentiated in parallel in the United States and Australia, strongly supporting the idea that they are influenced by spatially varying selection. Genomic differentiation is distributed nonrandomly with respect to gene function, even in regions differentiated on only one continent, providing further evidence for the role of selection. These data provide candidate genes for phenotypes known to vary clinally and implicate interesting new processes in genotype-by-environment interactions, including chorion proteins, proteins regulating meiotic recombination and segregation, gustatory and olfactory receptors, and proteins affecting synaptic function and behavior. This portrait of differentiation provides a genomic perspective on adaptation and the maintenance of variation through spatially varying selection.},

	Abstract = {Germ-line transformation via transposable elements is a powerful tool to study gene function in Drosophila melanogaster. However, some inherent characteristics of transposon-mediated transgenesis limit its use for transgene analysis. Here, we circumvent these limitations by optimizing a phiC31-based integration system. We generated a collection of lines with precisely mapped attP sites that allow the insertion of transgenes into many different predetermined intergenic locations throughout the fly genome. By using regulatory elements of the nanos and vasa genes, we established endogenous sources of the phiC31 integrase, eliminating the difficulties of coinjecting integrase mRNA and raising the transformation efficiency. Moreover, to discriminate between specific and rare nonspecific integration events, a white gene-based reconstitution system was generated that enables visual selection for precise attP targeting. Finally, we demonstrate that our chromosomal attP sites can be modified in situ, extending their scope while retaining their properties as landing sites. The efficiency, ease-of-use, and versatility obtained here with the phiC31-based integration system represents an important advance in transgenesis and opens up the possibility of systematic, high-throughput screening of large cDNA sets and regulatory elements.},

To this end, we report an analysis of 26,530 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with allele frequencies that were determined in three populations. Specifically, we calculated a measure of genetic differentiation, F(ST), for each locus and examined its distribution at the level of the genome, the chromosome, and individual genes. Through a variety of analyses, we have found statistically significant evidence supporting the hypothesis that selection has influenced extant patterns of human genetic variation. Importantly, by contrasting the F(ST) of individual SNPs to the empirical genome-wide distribution of F(ST), our results are not confounded by tenuous assumptions of population demographic history. Furthermore, we have identified 174 candidate genes with distribution of genetic variation that indicates that they have been targets of selection. Our work provides a first generation natural selection map of the human genome and provides compelling evidence that selection has shaped extant patterns of human genomic variation.},

We carried out a screen for genes with much greater transcript abundance in Drosophila simulans reproductive tracts than in Drosophila melanogaster reproductive tracts. Such genes could be present in both species but diverged dramatically in transcript abundance or could be present in D. simulans but absent from D. melanogaster. Here we report data from melanogaster subgroup species for three previously unknown accessory gland protein genes (Acps) identified in this screen. We found multiple Acps that were present in some lineages yet absent from other closely related melanogaster subgroup lineages, representing several losses of genes. An Acp that may have been lost in D. melanogaster and Drosophila erecta is segregating a null allele in Drosophila yakuba, yet shows evidence of adaptive protein evolution in contrasts of polymorphism and divergence within and between D. yakuba and its close relative, Drosophila teissieri. These data suggest that turnover of Acps occurs rapidly in Drosophila, consistent with rapid evolution of seminal fluid function.},

Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new, fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic variation. Here we report an approach that generates several billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth of paired 35-base reads.

	Abstract = {The traditional way of identifying targets of adaptive evolution has been to study a few loci that one hypothesizes a priori to have been under selection. This approach is complicated because of the confounding effects that population demographic history and selection have on patterns of DNA sequence variation. In principle, multilocus analyses can facilitate robust inferences of selection at individual loci. The deluge of large-scale catalogs of genetic variation has stimulated many genome-wide scans for positive selection in several species. Here, we review some of the salient observations of these studies, identify important challenges ahead, consider the limitations of genome-wide scans for selection and discuss the potential significance of a comprehensive understanding of genomic patterns of selection for disease-related research.},

	Abstract = {We define a "threaded blockset," which is a novel generalization of the classic notion of a multiple alignment. A new computer program called TBA (for "threaded blockset aligner") builds a threaded blockset under the assumption that all matching segments occur in the same order and orientation in the given sequences; inversions and duplications are not addressed. TBA is designed to be appropriate for aligning many, but by no means all, megabase-sized regions of multiple mammalian genomes. The output of TBA can be projected onto any genome chosen as a reference, thus guaranteeing that different projections present consistent predictions of which genomic positions are orthologous. This capability is illustrated using a new visualization tool to view TBA-generated alignments of vertebrate Hox clusters from both the mammalian and fish perspectives. Experimental evaluation of alignment quality, using a program that simulates evolutionary change in genomic sequences, indicates that TBA is more accurate than earlier programs. To perform the dynamic-programming alignment step, TBA runs a stand-alone program called MULTIZ, which can be used to align highly rearranged or incompletely sequenced genomes. We describe our use of MULTIZ to produce the whole-genome multiple alignments at the Santa Cruz Genome Browser.},

@article{Coop:2004pj,
	Abstract = {The extent to which natural selection shapes diversity within populations is a key question for population genetics. Thus, there is considerable interest in quantifying the strength of selection. A full likelihood approach for inference about selection at a single site within an otherwise neutral fully linked sequence of sites is described here. A coalescent model of evolution is used to model the ancestry of a sample of DNA sequences which have the selected site segregating. The mutation model, for the selected and neutral sites, is the infinitely many-sites model where there is no back or parallel mutation at sites. A unique perfect phylogeny, a gene tree, can be constructed from the configuration of mutations on the sample sequences under this model of mutation. The approach is general and can be used for any bi-allelic selection scheme. Selection is incorporated through modelling the frequency of the selected and neutral allelic classes stochastically back in time, then using a subdivided population model considering the population frequencies through time as variable population sizes. An importance sampling algorithm is then used to explore over coalescent tree space consistent with the data. The method is applied to a simulated data set and the gene tree presented in Verrelli et al. (2002).},

	Abstract = {Comparative analysis of multiple genomes in a phylogenetic framework dramatically improves the precision and sensitivity of evolutionary inference, producing more robust results than single-genome analyses can provide. The genomes of 12 Drosophila species, ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of these diverse species.},

The current release comprises 30 145 records curated from 922 publications and describing regulatory sequences for over 3853 genes and 465 transcription factors from 19 species. A new feature called the 'publication queue' allows users to input relevant papers from scientific literature as targets for annotation. The queue contains 4438 gene regulation papers entered by experts and another 54 351 identified by text-mining methods. Users can enter or 'check out' papers from the queue for manual curation using a series of user-friendly annotation pages. A typical record entry consists of species, sequence type, sequence, target gene, binding factor, experimental outcome and one or more lines of experimental evidence. An evidence ontology was developed to describe and categorize these experiments. Records are cross-referenced to Ensembl or Entrez gene identifiers, PubMed and dbSNP and can be visualized in the Ensembl or UCSC genome browsers.

	Abstract = {A new statistical method for estimating divergence dates of species from DNA sequence data by a molecular clock approach is developed. This method takes into account effectively the information contained in a set of DNA sequence data. The molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was calibrated by setting the date of divergence between primates and ungulates at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (65 million years ago), when the extinction of dinosaurs occurred. A generalized least-squares method was applied in fitting a model to mtDNA sequence data, and the clock gave dates of 92.3 +/- 11.7, 13.3 +/- 1.5, 10.9 +/- 1.2, 3.7 +/- 0.6, and 2.7 +/- 0.6 million years ago (where the second of each pair of numbers is the standard deviation) for the separation of mouse, gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee, respectively, from the line leading to humans. Although there is some uncertainty in the clock, this dating may pose a problem for the widely believed hypothesis that the pipedal creature Australopithecus afarensis, which lived some 3.7 million years ago at Laetoli in Tanzania and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was ancestral to man and evolved after the human-ape splitting. Another likelier possibility is that mtDNA was transferred through hybridization between a proto-human and a proto-chimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Locomotion is an integral component of most animal behaviors, and many human health problems are associated with locomotor deficits. Locomotor behavior is a complex trait, with population variation attributable to many interacting loci with small effects that are sensitive to environmental conditions. However, the genetic basis of this complex behavior is largely uncharacterized. RESULTS: We quantified locomotor behavior of Drosophila melanogaster in a large population of inbred lines derived from a single natural population, and derived replicated selection lines with different levels of locomotion. Estimates of broad-sense and narrow-sense heritabilities were 0.52 and 0.16, respectively, indicating substantial non-additive genetic variance for locomotor behavior. We used whole genome expression analysis to identify 1,790 probe sets with different expression levels between the selection lines when pooled across replicates, at a false discovery rate of 0.001. The transcriptional responses to selection for locomotor, aggressive and mating behavior from the same base population were highly overlapping, but the magnitude of the expression differences between selection lines for increased and decreased levels of behavior was uncorrelated. We assessed the locomotor behavior of ten mutations in candidate genes with altered transcript abundance between selection lines, and identified seven novel genes affecting this trait. CONCLUSION: Expression profiling of genetically divergent lines is an effective strategy for identifying genes affecting complex behaviors, and reveals that a large number of pleiotropic genes exhibit correlated transcriptional responses to multiple behaviors.},

This characteristic pattern can be used to detect recent directional selection on the basis of DNA polymorphism data. However, the large variance of nucleotide diversity in samples of moderate size imposes difficulties in detecting such patterns. We investigated the patterns of genetic variation along a recombining chromosome by constructing ancestral recombination graphs that are modified to incorporate the effect of genetic hitchhiking. A statistical method is proposed to test the significance of a local reduction of variation and a skew of the frequency spectrum caused by a hitchhiking event.

	Abstract = {New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the use of DNA sequence. However, some of these technologies produce very short reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and real data. MAQ is accurate, efficient, versatile, and user-friendly. It is freely available at http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We previously established that six sequence-specific transcription factors that initiate anterior/posterior patterning in Drosophila bind to overlapping sets of thousands of genomic regions in blastoderm embryos. While regions bound at high levels include known and probable functional targets, more poorly bound regions are preferentially associated with housekeeping genes and/or genes not transcribed in the blastoderm, and are frequently found in protein coding sequences or in less conserved non-coding DNA, suggesting that many are likely non-functional. RESULTS: Here we show that an additional 15 transcription factors that regulate other aspects of embryo patterning show a similar quantitative continuum of function and binding to thousands of genomic regions in vivo. Collectively, the 21 regulators show a surprisingly high overlap in the regions they bind given that they belong to 11 DNA binding domain families, specify distinct developmental fates, and can act via different cis-regulatory modules. We demonstrate, however, that quantitative differences in relative levels of binding to shared targets correlate with the known biological and transcriptional regulatory specificities of these factors. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that the overlap in binding of biochemically and functionally unrelated transcription factors arises from the high concentrations of these proteins in nuclei, which, coupled with their broad DNA binding specificities, directs them to regions of open chromatin. We suggest that most animal transcription factors will be found to show a similar broad overlapping pattern of binding in vivo, with specificity achieved by modulating the amount, rather than the identity, of bound factor.},

	Abstract = {Since the divergence of humans and chimpanzees about 5 million years ago, these species have undergone a remarkable evolution with drastic divergence in anatomy and cognitive abilities. At the molecular level, despite the small overall magnitude of DNA sequence divergence, we might expect such evolutionary changes to leave a noticeable signature throughout the genome. We here compare 13,731 annotated genes from humans to their chimpanzee orthologs to identify genes that show evidence of positive selection. Many of the genes that present a signature of positive selection tend to be involved in sensory perception or immune defenses. However, the group of genes that show the strongest evidence for positive selection also includes a surprising number of genes involved in tumor suppression and apoptosis, and of genes involved in spermatogenesis. We hypothesize that positive selection in some of these genes may be driven by genomic conflict due to apoptosis during spermatogenesis. Genes with maximal expression in the brain show little or no evidence for positive selection, while genes with maximal expression in the testis tend to be enriched with positively selected genes. Genes on the X chromosome also tend to show an elevated tendency for positive selection. We also present polymorphism data from 20 Caucasian Americans and 19 African Americans for the 50 annotated genes showing the strongest evidence for positive selection. The polymorphism analysis further supports the presence of positive selection in these genes by showing an excess of high-frequency derived nonsynonymous mutations.},

	Abstract = {Detecting selective sweeps from genomic SNP data is complicated by the intricate ascertainment schemes used to discover SNPs, and by the confounding influence of the underlying complex demographics and varying mutation and recombination rates. Current methods for detecting selective sweeps have little or no robustness to the demographic assumptions and varying recombination rates, and provide no method for correcting for ascertainment biases. Here, we present several new tests aimed at detecting selective sweeps from genomic SNP data. Using extensive simulations, we show that a new parametric test, based on composite likelihood, has a high power to detect selective sweeps and is surprisingly robust to assumptions regarding recombination rates and demography (i.e., has low Type I error). Our new test also provides estimates of the location of the selective sweep(s) and the magnitude of the selection coefficient. To illustrate the method, we apply our approach to data from the Seattle SNP project and to Chromosome 2 data from the HapMap project. In Chromosome 2, the most extreme signal is found in the lactase gene, which previously has been shown to be undergoing positive selection. Evidence for selective sweeps is also found in many other regions, including genes known to be associated with disease risk such as DPP10 and COL4A3.},

We found 202 genomic elements that are highly conserved in vertebrates but show evidence of significantly accelerated substitution rates in human. These are mostly in non-coding DNA, often near genes associated with transcription and DNA binding. Resequencing confirmed that the five most accelerated elements are dramatically changed in human but not in other primates, with seven times more substitutions in human than in chimp. The accelerated elements, and in particular the top five, show a strong bias for adenine and thymine to guanine and cytosine nucleotide changes and are disproportionately located in high recombination and high guanine and cytosine content environments near telomeres, suggesting either biased gene conversion or isochore selection. In addition, there is some evidence of directional selection in the regions containing the two most accelerated regions. A combination of evolutionary forces has contributed to accelerated evolution of the fastest evolving elements in the human genome.},

	Abstract = {Considerable interest is focused on the use of polymorphism data to identify regions of the genome that underlie recent adaptations. These searches are guided by a simple model of positive selection, in which a mutation is favored as soon as it arises. This assumption may not be realistic, as environmental changes and range expansions may lead previously neutral or deleterious alleles to become beneficial. We examine what effect this mode of selection has on patterns of variation at linked neutral sites by implementing a new coalescent model of positive directional selection on standing variation. In this model, a neutral allele arises and drifts in the population, then at frequency f becomes beneficial, and eventually reaches fixation. Depending on the value of f, this scenario can lead to a large variance in allele frequency spectra and in levels of linkage disequilibrium at linked, neutral sites. In particular, for intermediate f, the beneficial substitution often leads to a loss of rare alleles--a pattern that differs markedly from the signature of directional selection currently relied on by researchers. These findings highlight the importance of an accurate characterization of the effects of positive selection, if we are to reliably identify recent adaptations from polymorphism data.},

Recent evidence from Drosophila, reviewed here, suggests that this view may be invalid. Analyses of genetic variation within and between species reveal that much of the Drosophila genome is under purifying selection, and thus of functional importance, and that a large fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are adaptive. The findings further indicate that, in Drosophila, adaptations may be both common and strong enough that the fate of neutral mutations depends on their chance linkage to adaptive mutations as much as on the vagaries of genetic drift. The emerging evidence has implications for a wide variety of fields, from conservation genetics to bioinformatics, and presents challenges to modelers and experimentalists alike.},

	Abstract = {Mutation is the underlying force that provides the variation upon which evolutionary forces can act. It is important to understand how mutation rates vary within genomes and how the probabilities of fixation of new mutations vary as well. If substitutional processes across the genome are heterogeneous, then examining patterns of coding sequence evolution without taking these underlying variations into account may be misleading. Here we present the first rigorous test of substitution rate heterogeneity in the Drosophila melanogaster genome using almost 1500 nonfunctional fragments of the transposable element DNAREP1_DM. Not only do our analyses suggest that substitutional patterns in heterochromatic and euchromatic sequences are different, but also they provide support in favor of a recombination-associated substitutional bias toward G and C in this species. The magnitude of this bias is entirely sufficient to explain recombination-associated patterns of codon usage on the autosomes of the D. melanogaster genome. We also document a bias toward lower GC content in the pattern of small insertions and deletions (indels). In addition, the GC content of noncoding DNA in Drosophila is higher than would be predicted on the basis of the pattern of nucleotide substitutions and small indels. However, we argue that the fast turnover of noncoding sequences in Drosophila makes it difficult to assess the importance of the GC biases in nucleotide substitutions and small indels in shaping the base composition of noncoding sequences.},

	Abstract = {Population genetic analyses of the past two decades confirmed an earlier hypothesis by L Tsacas and D Lachaise that the cosmopolitan species Drosophila melanogaster has an Afrotropical origin, and that it colonized the rest of the world only very recently. Maximum likelihood analyses based on multilocus data suggest that the putative ancestral African population expanded its size about 60,000 years ago (ya). These demographic changes were accompanied by the fixation of numerous beneficial mutations, as revealed by signatures of positive directional selection in the genome (selective sweeps). The estimated rate of adaptive substitution on the X chromosome is in the order of 10(-11) per nucleotide site per generation. Comparable (but not significantly higher) substitution rates are found in derived populations that colonized new habitats outside Africa, such as in a European population that branched off from the African lineage about 16,000 ya.},

	Abstract = {Multiple-hypothesis testing involves guarding against much more complicated errors than single-hypothesis testing. Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach-we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR method.},

@article{Tajima:1990fx,
	Abstract = {When there is no recombination among nucleotide sites in DNA sequences, DNA polymorphism and fixation of mutants at nucleotide sites are mutually related. Using the method of gene genealogy, the relationship between the DNA polymorphism and the fixation of mutant nucleotide was quantitatively investigated under the assumption that mutants are selectively neutral, that there is no recombination among nucleotide sites, and that the population is a random mating population with N diploid individuals. The results obtained indicate that the expected number of nucleotide differences between two DNA sequences randomly sampled from the population is 42% less when a mutant at a particular nucleotide site reaches fixation than at a random time, and that heterozygosity is also expected to be less when fixation takes place than at a random time, but the amount of reduction depends on the value of 4Nv in this case, where v is the mutation rate per DNA sequence per generation. The formula for obtaining the expected number of nucleotide differences between the two DNA sequences for a given fixation time is also derived, and indicates that, even when it takes a large number of generations for a mutant to reach fixation, this number is 33% less than at a random time. The computer simulation conducted suggests that the expected number of nucleotide differences between the two DNA sequences at the time when an advantageous mutant becomes fixed is essentially the same as that of neutral mutant if the fixation time is the same. The effect of recombination on the amount of DNA polymorphism was also investigated by using computer simulation.},

We describe its genome sequence here. This omnivorous beetle has evolved the ability to interact with a diverse chemical environment, as shown by large expansions in odorant and gustatory receptors, as well as P450 and other detoxification enzymes. Development in Tribolium is more representative of other insects than is Drosophila, a fact reflected in gene content and function. For example, Tribolium has retained more ancestral genes involved in cell-cell communication than Drosophila, some being expressed in the growth zone crucial for axial elongation in short-germ development. Systemic RNA interference in T. castaneum functions differently from that in Caenorhabditis elegans, but nevertheless offers similar power for the elucidation of gene function and identification of targets for selective insect control.},

Using statistical methods that account for the confounding effects of population demography, recombination rate variation, and single-nucleotide polymorphism ascertainment, while also providing fine-scale estimates of the position of the selected site, we analyzed a genomic dataset of 1.2 million human single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in African-American, European-American, and Chinese samples. We identify 101 regions of the human genome with very strong evidence (p < 10(-5)) of a recent selective sweep and where our estimate of the position of the selective sweep falls within 100 kb of a known gene. Within these regions, genes of biological interest include genes in pigmentation pathways, components of the dystrophin protein complex, clusters of olfactory receptors, genes involved in nervous system development and function, immune system genes, and heat shock genes. We also observe consistent evidence of selective sweeps in centromeric regions. In general, we find that recent adaptation is strikingly pervasive in the human genome, with as much as 10% of the genome affected by linkage to a selective sweep.},

	Abstract = {Natural selection and demographic forces can have similar effects on patterns of DNA polymorphism. Therefore, to infer selection from samples of DNA sequences, one must simultaneously account for demographic effects. Here we take a model-based approach to this problem by developing predictions for patterns of polymorphism in the presence of both population size change and natural selection. If data are available from different functional classes of variation, and a priori information suggests that mutations in one of those classes are selectively neutral, then the putatively neutral class can be used to infer demographic parameters, and inferences regarding selection on other classes can be performed given demographic parameter estimates. This procedure is more robust to assumptions regarding the true underlying demography than previous approaches to detecting and analyzing selection. We apply this method to a large polymorphism data set from 301 human genes and find (i) widespread negative selection acting on standing nonsynonymous variation, (ii) that the fitness effects of nonsynonymous mutations are well predicted by several measures of amino acid exchangeability, especially site-specific methods, and (iii) strong evidence for very recent population growth.},

A model of nucleotide or amino acid substitution was employed to analyze data of the present-day sequences, and maximum likelihood estimates of parameters such as branch lengths were used to compare the posterior probabilities of assignments of character states (nucleotides or amino acids) to interior nodes of the tree; the assignment having the highest probability was the best reconstruction at the site. The lysozyme c sequences of six mammals were analyzed by using the likelihood and parsimony methods. The new likelihood-based method was found to be superior to the parsimony method. The probability that the amino acids for all interior nodes at a site reconstructed by the new method are correct was calculated to be 0.91, 0.86, and 0.73 for all, variable, and parsimony-informative sites, respectively, whereas the corresponding probabilities for the parsimony method were 0.84, 0.76, and 0.51, respectively.

Uses of the programs include estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates (d(N) and d(S)) between two protein-coding DNA sequences, inference of positive Darwinian selection through phylogenetic comparison of protein-coding genes, reconstruction of ancestral genes and proteins for molecular restoration studies of extinct life forms, combined analysis of heterogeneous data sets from multiple gene loci, and estimation of species divergence times incorporating uncertainties in fossil calibrations.

	Abstract = {Identifying genomic locations that have experienced selective sweeps is an important first step toward understanding the molecular basis of adaptive evolution. Using statistical methods that account for the confounding effects of population demography, recombination rate variation, and single-nucleotide polymorphism ascertainment, while also providing fine-scale estimates of the position of the selected site, we analyzed a genomic dataset of 1.2 million human single-nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in African-American, European-American, and Chinese samples. We identify 101 regions of the human genome with very strong evidence (p < 10(-5)) of a recent selective sweep and where our estimate of the position of the selective sweep falls within 100 kb of a known gene. Within these regions, genes of biological interest include genes in pigmentation pathways, components of the dystrophin protein complex, clusters of olfactory receptors, genes involved in nervous system development and function, immune system genes, and heat shock genes. We also observe consistent evidence of selective sweeps in centromeric regions. In general, we find that recent adaptation is strikingly pervasive in the human genome, with as much as 10\% of the genome affected by linkage to a selective sweep.},

	Abstract = {Balancing selection is potentially an important biological force for maintaining advantageous genetic diversity in populations, including variation that is responsible for long-term adaptation to the environment. By serving as a means to maintain genetic variation, it may be particularly relevant to maintaining phenotypic variation in natural populations. Nevertheless, its prevalence and specific targets in the human genome remain largely unknown. We have analyzed the patterns of diversity and divergence of 13,400 genes in two human populations using an unbiased single-nucleotide polymorphism data set, a genome-wide approach, and a method that incorporates demography in neutrality tests. We identified an unbiased catalog of genes with signatures of long-term balancing selection, which includes immunity genes as well as genes encoding keratins and membrane channels; the catalog also shows enrichment in functional categories involved in cellular structure. Patterns are mostly concordant in the two populations, with a small fraction of genes showing population-specific signatures of selection. Power considerations indicate that our findings represent a subset of all targets in the genome, suggesting that although balancing selection may not have an obvious impact on a large proportion of human genes, it is a key force affecting the evolution of a number of genes in humans.},

In contrast to earlier approaches, our HMMs explicitly model the correlation structure between linked sites. The detection power of our methods, and their accuracy for estimating the selected site location, is similar to that of competing methods for constant size populations.

	Abstract = {There is currently large interest in distinguishing the signatures of genetic variation produced by demographic events from those produced by natural selection. We propose a simple multilocus statistical test to identify candidate sites of selective sweeps with high power. The test is based on the variability profile measured in an array of linked microsatellites. We also show that the analysis of flanking markers drastically reduces the number of false positives among the candidates that are identified in a genomewide survey of unlinked loci and find that this property is maintained in many population-bottleneck scenarios. However, for a certain range of intermediately severe population bottlenecks we find genomic signatures that are very similar to those produced by a selective sweep. While in these worst-case scenarios the power of the proposed test remains high, the false-positive rate reaches values close to 50\%. Hence, selective sweeps may be hard to identify even if multiple linked loci are analyzed. Nevertheless, the integration of information from multiple linked loci always leads to a considerable reduction of the false-positive rate compared to a genome scan of unlinked loci. We discuss the application of this test to experimental data from Drosophila melanogaster.},

We developed a maximum likelihood method that allows us to infer demographic changes and detect recent positive selection (selective sweeps) in populations of varying size from DNA polymorphism data. Applying this approach to single nucleotide polymorphism data at more than 250 noncoding loci on the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster from an (ancestral) African population and a (derived) European, we found that the African population expanded about 60,000 y ago and that the European population split off from the African lineage about 15,800 y ago, thereby suffering a severe population size bottleneck. We estimated that about 160 beneficial mutations (with selection coefficients s between 0.05\% and 0.5\%) were fixed in the euchromatic portion of the X in the African population since population size expansion, and about 60 mutations (with s around 0.5\%) in the diverging European lineage.},

	Abstract = {Several recent studies have estimated that a large fraction of amino acid divergence between species of Drosophila was fixed by positive selection, using statistical approaches based on the McDonald-Kreitman test. However, little is known about associated selection coefficients of beneficial amino acid mutations. Recurrent selective sweeps associated with adaptive substitutions should leave a characteristic signature in genome variability data that contains information about the frequency and strength of selection. Here, I document a significant negative correlation between the level and the frequency of synonymous site polymorphism and the rate of protein evolution in highly recombining regions of the X chromosome of D. melanogaster. This pattern is predicted by recurrent adaptive protein evolution and suggests that adaptation is an important determinant of patterns of neutral variation genome-wide. Using a maximum likelihood approach, I estimate the product of the rate and strength of selection under a recurrent genetic hitchhiking model, lambda2N(e)s approximately 3 x 10(-8). Using an approach based on the McDonald-Kreitman test, I estimate that approximately 50\% of divergent amino acids were driven to fixation by positive selection, implying that beneficial amino acid substitutions are of weak effect on average, on the order of 10(-5) (i.e., 2N(e)s approximately 40). Two implications of these results are that most adaptive substitutions will be difficult to detect in genome scans of selection and that population size (and genetic drift) may be an important determinant of the evolutionary dynamics of protein adaptation.},

	Abstract = {Much effort and interest have focused on assessing the importance of natural selection, particularly positive natural selection, in shaping the human genome. Although scans for positive selection have identified candidate loci that may be associated with positive selection in humans, such scans do not indicate whether adaptation is frequent in general in humans. Studies based on the reasoning of the MacDonald-Kreitman test, which, in principle, can be used to evaluate the extent of positive selection, suggested that adaptation is detectable in the human genome but that it is less common than in Drosophila or Escherichia coli. Both positive and purifying natural selection at functional sites should affect levels and patterns of polymorphism at linked nonfunctional sites. Here, we search for these effects by analyzing patterns of neutral polymorphism in humans in relation to the rates of recombination, functional density, and functional divergence with chimpanzees. We find that the levels of neutral polymorphism are lower in the regions of lower recombination and in the regions of higher functional density or divergence. These correlations persist after controlling for the variation in GC content, density of simple repeats, selective constraint, mutation rate, and depth of sequencing coverage. We argue that these results are most plausibly explained by the effects of natural selection at functional sites -- either recurrent selective sweeps or background selection -- on the levels of linked neutral polymorphism. Natural selection at both coding and regulatory sites appears to affect linked neutral polymorphism, reducing neutral polymorphism by 6\% genome-wide and by 11\% in the gene-rich half of the human genome. These findings suggest that the effects of natural selection at linked sites cannot be ignored in the study of neutral human polymorphism.},

One of these insertions, Bari-Juvenile hormone epoxy hydrolase (Bari-Jheh), was associated with the selective sweep of its flanking neutral variation and with reduction of expression of one of its neighboring genes: Jheh3. Here, we provide further evidence that Bari-Jheh insertion is adaptive. We delimit the extent of the selective sweep and show that Bari-Jheh is the only mutation linked to the sweep. Bari-Jheh also lowers the expression of its other flanking gene, Jheh2. Subtle consequences of Bari-Jheh insertion on life-history traits are consistent with the effects of reduced expression of the Jheh genes. Finally, we analyze molecular evolution of Jheh genes in both the long- and the short-term and conclude that Bari-Jheh appears to be a very rare adaptive event in the history of these genes. We discuss the implications of these findings for the detection and understanding of adaptation.},

	Abstract = {Although transposable elements (TEs) are known to be potent sources of mutation, their contribution to the generation of recent adaptive changes has never been systematically assessed. In this work, we conduct a genome-wide screen for adaptive TE insertions in Drosophila melanogaster that have taken place during or after the spread of this species out of Africa. We determine population frequencies of 902 of the 1,572 TEs in Release 3 of the D. melanogaster genome and identify a set of 13 putatively adaptive TEs. These 13 TEs increased in population frequency sharply after the spread out of Africa. We argue that many of these TEs are in fact adaptive by demonstrating that the regions flanking five of these TEs display signatures of partial selective sweeps. Furthermore, we show that eight out of the 13 putatively adaptive elements show population frequency heterogeneity consistent with these elements playing a role in adaptation to temperate climates. We conclude that TEs have contributed considerably to recent adaptive evolution (one TE-induced adaptation every 200-1,250 y). The majority of these adaptive insertions are likely to be involved in regulatory changes. Our results also suggest that TE-induced adaptations arise more often from standing variants than from new mutations. Such a high rate of TE-induced adaptation is inconsistent with the number of fixed TEs in the D. melanogaster genome, and we discuss possible explanations for this discrepancy.},

	Abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) constitute a substantial fraction of the genomes of many species, and it is thus important to understand their population dynamics. The strength of natural selection against TEs is a key parameter in understanding these dynamics. In principle, the strength of selection can be inferred from the frequencies of a sample of TEs. However, complicated demographic histories, such as found in Drosophila melanogaster, could lead to a substantial distortion of the TE frequency distribution compared with that expected for a panmictic, constant-sized population. The current methodology for the estimation of selection intensity acting against TEs does not take into account demographic history and might generate erroneous estimates especially for TE families under weak selection. Here, we develop a flexible maximum likelihood methodology that explicitly accounts both for demographic history and for the ascertainment biases of identifying TEs. We apply this method to the newly generated frequency data of the BS family of non-long terminal repeat retrotransposons in D. melanogaster in concert with two recent models of the demographic history of the species to infer the intensity of selection against this family. We find the estimate to differ substantially compared with a prior estimate that was made assuming a model of constant population size. Further, we find there to be relatively little information about selection intensity present in the derived non-African frequency data and that the ancestral African subpopulation is much more informative in this respect. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for demographic history and bear on study design for the inference of selection coefficients generally.},

We use coalescent simulations to explore whether incorporation of the species' demographic history, purifying selection against the element, or suppression of recombination caused by the element could generate putatively adaptive haplotype configurations. Whereas most of the data sets would be rejected as nonneutral under the standard neutral null model, only the data set for which there is strong external evidence in support of an adaptive transposition appears to be nonneutral under the more complex null model and in particular when demography is taken into account.

	Abstract = {The effect of recurrent selective sweeps is a spatially heterogeneous reduction in neutral polymorphism throughout the genome. The pattern of reduction depends on the selective advantage and recurrence rate of the sweeps. Because many adaptive substitutions responsible for these sweeps also contribute to nonsynonymous divergence, the spatial distribution of nonsynonymous divergence also reflects the distribution of adaptive substitutions. Thus, the spatial correspondence between neutral polymorphism and nonsynonymous divergence may be especially informative about the process of adaptation. Here we study this correspondence using genomewide polymorphism data from Drosophila simulans and the divergence between D. simulans and D. melanogaster. Focusing on highly recombining portions of the autosomes, at a spatial scale appropriate to the study of selective sweeps, we find that neutral polymorphism is both lower and, as measured by a new statistic Q(S), less homogeneous where nonsynonymous divergence is higher and that the spatial structure of this correlation is best explained by the action of strong recurrent selective sweeps. We introduce a method to infer, from the spatial correspondence between polymorphism and divergence, the rate and selective strength of adaptation. Our results independently confirm a high rate of adaptive substitution (approximately 1/3000 generations) and newly suggest that many adaptations are of surprisingly great selective effect (approximately 1\%), reducing the effective population size by approximately 15\% even in highly recombining regions of the genome.},

	Abstract = {We have estimated the selective effects of amino acid replacements in natural populations by comparing levels of polymorphism in 91 genes in African populations of Drosophila melanogaster with their divergence from Drosophila simulans. The genes include about equal numbers whose level of expression in adults is greater in males, greater in females, or approximately equal in the sexes. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to sample key parameters in the stationary distribution of polymorphism and divergence in a model in which the selective effect of each nonsynonymous mutation is regarded as a random sample from some underlying normal distribution whose mean may differ from one gene to the next. Our analysis suggests that approximately 95\% of all nonsynonymous mutations that could contribute to polymorphism or divergence are deleterious, and that the average proportion of deleterious amino acid polymorphisms in samples is approximately 70\%. On the other hand, approximately 95\% of fixed differences between species are positively selected, although the scaled selection coefficient (N(e)s) is very small. We estimate that approximately 46\% of amino acid replacements have N(e)s < 2, approximately 84\% have N(e)s < 4, and approximately 99\% have N(e)s < 7. Although positive selection among amino acid differences between species seems pervasive, most of the selective effects could be regarded as nearly neutral. There are significant differences in selection between sex-biased and unbiased genes, which relate primarily to the mean of the distributions of mutational effects and the fraction of slightly deleterious and weakly beneficial mutations that are fixed.},

	Abstract = {Over the past four decades, the predominant view of molecular evolution saw little connection between natural selection and genome evolution, assuming that the functionally constrained fraction of the genome is relatively small and that adaptation is sufficiently infrequent to play little role in shaping patterns of variation within and even between species. Recent evidence from Drosophila, reviewed here, suggests that this view may be invalid. Analyses of genetic variation within and between species reveal that much of the Drosophila genome is under purifying selection, and thus of functional importance, and that a large fraction of coding and noncoding differences between species are adaptive. The findings further indicate that, in Drosophila, adaptations may be both common and strong enough that the fate of neutral mutations depends on their chance linkage to adaptive mutations as much as on the vagaries of genetic drift. The emerging evidence has implications for a wide variety of fields, from conservation genetics to bioinformatics, and presents challenges to modelers and experimentalists alike.},

	Abstract = {Despite compelling evidence that adaptation to local climate is common in plant populations, little is known about the evolutionary genetics of traits that contribute to climatic adaptation. A screen of natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed Tsu-1 and Kas-1 to be opposite extremes for water-use efficiency and climate at collection sites for these accessions differs greatly. To provide a tool to understand the genetic basis of this putative adaptation, Kas-1 and Tsu-1 were reciprocally crossed to create a new mapping population. Analysis of F(3) families showed segregating variation in both delta(13)C and transpiration rate, and as expected these traits had a negative genetic correlation (r(g)=- 0.3). 346 RILs, 148 with Kas-1 cytoplasm and 198 with Tsu-1 cytoplasm, were advanced to the F(9) and genotyped using 48 microsatellites and 55 SNPs for a total of 103 markers. This mapping population was used for QTL analysis of delta(13)C using F(9) RIL means. Analysis of this reciprocal cross showed a large effect of cytoplasmic background, as well as two QTL for delta(13)C. The Kas-1 x Tsu-1 mapping population provides a powerful new resource for mapping QTL underlying natural variation and for dissecting the genetic basis of water-use efficiency differences.},

After its geographic isolation on these islands, D. sechellia evolved into a host specialist on the fruit of Morinda citrifolia--a fruit often noxious and repulsive to Drosophila. Specialization on M. citrifolia required the evolution of a suite of adaptations, including resistance to and preference for some of the toxins found in this fruit. Several of these adaptive traits have been studied genetically. Here, I summarize what is known about the genetics of these traits and briefly describe the ecological and geographical context that shaped the evolution of these characters. The data from D. sechellia suggest that adaptations are not as genetically complex as historically thought, although almost all of the adaptations of D. sechellia involve several genes.},

	Abstract = {Proteins often differ in amino-acid sequence across species. This difference has evolved by the accumulation of neutral mutations by random drift, the fixation of adaptive mutations by selection, or a mixture of the two. Here we propose a simple statistical test of the neutral protein evolution hypothesis based on a comparison of the number of amino-acid replacement substitutions to synonymous substitutions in the coding region of a locus. If the observed substitutions are neutral, the ratio of replacement to synonymous fixed differences between species should be the same as the ratio of replacement to synonymous polymorphisms within species. DNA sequence data on the Adh locus (encoding alcohol dehydrogenase, EC 1.1.1.1) in three species in the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup do not fit this expectation; instead, there are more fixed replacement differences between species than expected. We suggest that these excess replacement substitutions result from adaptive fixation of selectively advantageous mutations.},

	Abstract = {Two genomic regions with unusually low recombination rates in Drosophila melanogaster have normal levels of divergence but greatly reduced nucleotide diversity, apparently resulting from the fixation of advantageous mutations and the associated hitch-hiking effect. Here we show that for 20 gene regions from across the genome, the amount of nucleotide diversity in natural populations of D. melanogaster is positively correlated with the regional rate of recombination. This cannot be explained by variation in mutation rates and/or functional constraint, because we observe no correlation between recombination rates and DNA sequence divergence between D. melanogaster and its sibling species, D. simulans. We suggest that the correlation may result from genetic hitch-hiking associated with the fixation of advantageous mutants. Hitch-hiking thus seems to occur over a large fraction of the Drosophila genome and may constitute a major constraint on levels of genetic variation in nature.},

	Abstract = {The genealogical relationship of human, chimpanzee, and gorilla varies along the genome. We develop a hidden Markov model (HMM) that incorporates this variation and relate the model parameters to population genetics quantities such as speciation times and ancestral population sizes. Our HMM is an analytically tractable approximation to the coalescent process with recombination, and in simulations we see no apparent bias in the HMM estimates. We apply the HMM to four autosomal contiguous human-chimp-gorilla-orangutan alignments comprising a total of 1.9 million base pairs. We find a very recent speciation time of human-chimp (4.1 +/- 0.4 million years), and fairly large ancestral effective population sizes (65,000 +/- 30,000 for the human-chimp ancestor and 45,000 +/- 10,000 for the human-chimp-gorilla ancestor). Furthermore, around 50\% of the human genome coalesces with chimpanzee after speciation with gorilla. We also consider 250,000 base pairs of X-chromosome alignments and find an effective population size much smaller than 75\% of the autosomal effective population sizes. Finally, we find that the rate of transitions between different genealogies correlates well with the region-wide present-day human recombination rate, but does not correlate with the fine-scale recombination rates and recombination hot spots, suggesting that the latter are evolutionarily transient.},

Here we introduce the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs) for the detection of selective sweeps in DNA sequences. Like previously published methods, our HMMs use the site frequency spectrum, and the spatial pattern of diversity along the sequence, to identify selection. In contrast to earlier approaches, our HMMs explicitly model the correlation structure between linked sites. The detection power of our methods, and their accuracy for estimating the selected site location, is similar to that of competing methods for constant size populations. In the case of population bottlenecks, however, our methods frequently showed fewer false positives.},

However, selection of candidate regions for further study on the basis of elevated or depressed divergence between species leads to a divergence-based ascertainment bias in the site frequency spectrum within selected candidate loci. Here, a method to correct this problem is developed that obtains maximum-likelihood estimates of the unascertained allele frequency distribution using numerical optimization. I show how divergence-based ascertainment may mimic the effects of natural selection and offer correction formulae for performing proper estimation into the strength of selection in candidate regions in a maximum-likelihood setting.},

	Abstract = {Considerable interest is focused on the use of polymorphism data to identify regions of the genome that underlie recent adaptations. These searches are guided by a simple model of positive selection, in which a mutation is favored as soon as it arises. This assumption may not be realistic, as environmental changes and range expansions may lead previously neutral or deleterious alleles to become beneficial. We examine what effect this mode of selection has on patterns of variation at linked neutral sites by implementing a new coalescent model of positive directional selection on standing variation. In this model, a neutral allele arises and drifts in the population, then at frequency f becomes beneficial, and eventually reaches fixation. Depending on the value of f, this scenario can lead to a large variance in allele frequency spectra and in levels of linkage disequilibrium at linked, neutral sites. In particular, for intermediate f, the beneficial substitution often leads to a loss of rare alleles--a pattern that differs markedly from the signature of directional selection currently relied on by researchers. These findings highlight the importance of an accurate characterization of the effects of positive selection, if we are to reliably identify recent adaptations from polymorphism data.},

	Abstract = {We generated and characterized greater than 500 Drosophila strains that carry single copies of a novel P-element enhancer detector. In the majority of the strains, the beta-galactosidase reporter gene in the P-transposon responds to nearby transcriptional regulatory sequences in the genome. A remarkable diversity of spatially and temporally regulated staining patterns is observed in embryos carrying different insertions. We selected numerous strains as markers for different embryonic organs, tissues, and cells. Many of these strains should allow the study of complex developmental processes, such as nervous system development, which have not been convenient to analyze previously. Also, we present genetic evidence that some of the detected regulatory elements control nearby Drosophila genes. In light of our results, we discuss the diversity and complexity of cis-acting regulatory elements in the genome and the general applications of the enhancer detector method for the study of Drosophila development.},

	Abstract = {The extensive infraabdominal (iab) region contains a number of cis-regulatory elements, including enhancers, silencers, and insulators responsible for directing the developmental expression of the abdominal-A and Abdominal-B homeotic genes at the Drosophila bithorax complex. It is unclear how these regulatory elements are primed for activity early in embryogenesis, but the 100-kb intergenic region is subject to a complex transcriptional program. Here, we use molecular and genetic methods to examine the functional activity of the RNAs produced from this region and their role in cis regulation. We show that a subset of these transcripts demonstrates a distinct pattern of cellular localization. Furthermore, the transcripts from each iab region are discrete and the transcripts do not spread across the insulator elements that delineate the iab regions. In embryos carrying a Mcp deletion, the intergenic transcription pattern is disrupted in the iab4 region and the fourth abdominal segment is transformed into the fifth. We propose that intergenic transcription is required early in embryogenesis to initiate the activation of the Drosophila bithorax complex and define the domains of activity for the iab cis-regulatory elements. We also discuss a possible mechanism by which this may occur.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a non-radioactive in situ hybridization technique for the localization of RNA in whole mount Drosophila embryos. After fixation, whole embryos are hybridized in situ with a DNA probe which has been labeled with digoxygenin. The hybridization products are detected by using a phosphatase-coupled antibody against digoxygenin. In parallel experiments, embryos can be treated with an antibody directed against the corresponding protein product to allow the detection of its distribution using standard immunochemical techniques. We have used this approach to compare the spatial and temporal distribution patterns of the RNA and protein products of the segmentation gene hunchback (hb) during the early stages of embryogenesis. This comparison revealed translational control of the maternally derived hb mRNA, which was difficult to detect by conventional techniques. The non-radioactive in situ hybridization method is as sensitive as conventional methods, but is faster and easier to perform. This may make it a useful tool for a variety of other systems.},

	Abstract = {A gradient of the maternal morphogen dorsal (dl) initiates the differentiation of various tissues along the dorsal-ventral axis of early Drosophila embryos. dl is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that is related to the mammalian regulatory factor NF-kappa B. Previous studies suggest that dl can function as a transcriptional repressor. To determine how dl functions as an activator we have examined the promoter of the mesoderm determinant gene twist (twi). Genetic studies suggest that peak levels of dl protein in ventral regions of early embryos initiate twi expression. Using a combination of promoter fusion-P-transformation assays, and in vitro DNA-binding assays coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, we establish a direct link between dl-binding sites and twi expression in the early embryo. We also present evidence that the dorsal-ventral limits of twi expression depend on the number and affinity of dl-binding sites present in its promoter. A comparison of twi with a second dl target gene, zen, suggests a correlation between the affinities of dl-binding sites and response to different thresholds of dl morphogen.},

@article{Marthetal2004,
	Abstract = {We have studied a genome-wide set of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele frequency measures for African-American, East Asian, and European-American samples. For this analysis we derived a simple, closed mathematical formulation for the spectrum of expected allele frequencies when the sampled populations have experienced nonstationary demographic histories. The direct calculation generates the spectrum orders of magnitude faster than coalescent simulations do and allows us to generate spectra for a large number of alternative histories on a multidimensional parameter grid. Model-fitting experiments using this grid reveal significant population-specific differences among the demographic histories that best describe the observed allele frequency spectra. European and Asian spectra show a bottleneck-shaped history: a reduction of effective population size in the past followed by a recent phase of size recovery. In contrast, the African-American spectrum shows a history of moderate but uninterrupted population expansion. These differences are expected to have profound consequences for the design of medical association studies. The analytical methods developed for this study, i.e., a closed mathematical formulation for the allele frequency spectrum, correcting the ascertainment bias introduced by shallow SNP sampling, and dealing with variable sample sizes provide a general framework for the analysis of public variation data.},

@article{Chiangetal2008,
	Abstract = {Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are sequences that are identical between reference genomes of distantly related species. As they are under negative selection and enriched near or in specific classes of genes, one explanation for their ultraconservation may be their involvement in important functions. Indeed, many UCEs can drive tissue-specific gene expression. We have demonstrated that nonexonic UCEs are depleted among segmental duplications (SDs) and copy number variants (CNVs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison. Here, we report that nonexonic UCEs are also depleted among 10 of 11 recent genomewide data sets of human CNVs, including 3 obtained with strategies permitting greater precision in determining the extents of CNVs. We further present observations suggesting that nonexonic UCEs per se may contribute to this depletion and that their apparent dosage sensitivity was in effect when they became fixed in the last common ancestor of mammals, birds, and reptiles, consistent with dosage sensitivity contributing to ultraconservation. Finally, in searching for the mechanism(s) underlying the function of nonexonic UCEs, we have found that they are enriched in TAATTA, which is also the recognition sequence for the homeodomain DNA-binding module, and bounded by a change in A + T frequency.},

	Abstract = {We have designed a system for targeted gene expression that allows the selective activation of any cloned gene in a wide variety of tissue- and cell-specific patterns. The gene encoding the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 is inserted randomly into the Drosophila genome to drive GAL4 expression from one of a diverse array of genomic enhancers. It is then possible to introduce a gene containing GAL4 binding sites within its promoter, to activate it in those cells where GAL4 is expressed, and to observe the effect of this directed misexpression on development. We have used GAL4-directed transcription to expand the domain of embryonic expression of the homeobox protein even-skipped. We show that even-skipped represses wingless and transforms cells that would normally secrete naked cuticle into denticle secreting cells. The GAL4 system can thus be used to study regulatory interactions during embryonic development. In adults, targeted expression can be used to generate dominant phenotypes for use in genetic screens. We have directed expression of an activated form of the Dras2 protein, resulting in dominant eye and wing defects that can be used in screens to identify other members of the Dras2 signal transduction pathway.},

This activation requires two functions of the protein: a DNA binding domain located near the amino terminus, and one or more 'activating regions'. The 'activating regions' are highly acidic (see also ref. 12) and can be replaced, for example, by a short peptide designed to form a negatively charged, amphipathic alpha-helix. GAL4, as well as deletion derivatives bearing one or more 'activating regions' attached to the DNA binding domain, activates transcription in cultured mammalian cells from mammalian promoters linked to a UASG (refs 14, 15). Here we show that GAL4, when expressed in particular tissues of Drosophila larvae, stimulates tissue-specific transcription of a Drosophila promoter linked to GAL4 binding sites.},

In contrast, genetic recoding by adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing seems common in animals; usually, altering highly conserved or invariant coding positions in proteins. Here I report striking variation between species in the recoding of synaptotagmin I (sytI). Fruitflies, mosquitoes and butterflies possess shared and species-specific sytI editing sites, all within a single exon. Honeybees, beetles and roaches do not edit sytI. The editing machinery is usually directed to modify particular adenosines by information stored in intron-mediated RNA structures. Combining comparative genomics of 34 species with mutational analysis reveals that complex, multi-domain, pre-mRNA structures solely determine species-appropriate RNA editing. One of these is a previously unreported long-range pseudoknot. I show that small changes to intronic sequences, far removed from an editing site, can transfer the species specificity of editing between RNA substrates. Taken together, these data support a phylogeny of sytI gene editing spanning more than 250 million years of hexapod evolution. The results also provide models for the genesis of RNA editing sites through the stepwise addition of structural domains, or by short walks through sequence space from ancestral structures.},

Yet, in spite of the apparent abundance of ncRNA, little is known about the biological role of the projected thousands of ncRNA genes present in the human genome. To facilitate functional analysis of these RNAs, we have created an arrayed library of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) directed against 512 evolutionarily conserved putative ncRNAs and, via cell-based assays, we have begun to determine their roles in cellular pathways. Using this system, we have identified an ncRNA repressor of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), which interacts with multiple proteins including members of the importin-beta superfamily and likely functions as a specific regulator of NFAT nuclear trafficking.},

	Abstract = {New opportunities in mammalian functional genomics are emerging through the combination of high throughput technology and methods that allow manipulation of gene expression in living cells. Here we describe the application of an RNAi-based forward genomics approach toward understanding the biology and mechanism of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. TRAIL is a TNF superfamily member that induces selective cytotoxicity of tumor cells when bound to its cognate receptors. In addition to detecting well-characterized genes in the apoptosis pathway, we uncover several modulators including DOBI, a gene required for progression of the apoptotic signal through the intrinsic mitochondrial cell death pathway, and MIRSA, a gene that acts to limit TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, our data suggest a role for MYC and the WNT pathway in maintaining susceptibility to TRAIL. Collectively, these observations offer several insights on how TRAIL mediates the selective killing of tumor cells and demonstrate the utility of large-scale RNAi screens in mammalian cells.},

	Abstract = {RNAi is a gene-silencing phenomenon mediated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and has become a powerful tool to elucidate gene function. To accomplish rapid construction of transgenes expressing dsRNA in Drosophila, we developed a novel transformation vector, pRISE, which contains an inverted repeat of the attR1-ccdB-attR2 cassette for in vitro recombination and a pentameric GAL4 binding site for conditional expression. These features enabled us to construct RNAi transgenes without a complicated cloning scheme. In cultured cells and transgenic flies, pRISE constructs carrying dsRNA transgenes induced effective RNAi against an EGFP transgene and the endogenous white gene, respectively. These results indicate that pRISE is a convenient transformation vector for studies of multiple Drosophila genes for which functional information is lacking.},

@article{Bravermanetal1995,
	Abstract = {The level of DNA sequence variation is reduced in regions of the Drosophila melanogaster genome where the rate of crossing over per physical distance is also reduced. This observation has been interpreted as support for the simple model of genetic hitchhiking, in which directional selection on rare variants, e.g., newly arising advantageous mutants, sweeps linked neutral alleles to fixation, thus eliminating polymorphisms near the selected site. However, the frequency spectra of segregating sites of several loci from some populations exhibiting reduced levels of nucleotide diversity and reduced numbers of segregating sites did not appear different from what would be expected under a neutral equilibrium model. Specifically, a skew toward an excess of rare sites was not observed in these samples, as measured by Tajima's D. Because this skew was predicted by a simple hitchhiking model, yet it had never been expressed quantitatively and compared directly to DNA polymorphism data, this paper investigates the hitchhiking effect on the site frequency spectrum, as measured by Tajima's D and several other statistics, using a computer simulation model based on the coalescent process and recurrent hitchhiking events. The results presented here demonstrate that under the simple hitchhiking model (1) the expected value of Tajima's D is large and negative (indicating a skew toward rare variants), (2) that Tajima's test has reasonable power to detect a skew in the frequency spectrum for parameters comparable to those from actual data sets, and (3) that the Tajima's Ds observed in several data sets are very unlikely to have been the result of simple hitchhiking. Consequently, the simple hitchhiking model is not a sufficient explanation for the DNA polymorphism at those loci exhibiting a decreased number of segregating sites yet not exhibiting a skew in the frequency spectrum.},

Maximum likelihood analyses based on multilocus data suggest that the putative ancestral African population expanded its size about 60,000 years ago (ya). These demographic changes were accompanied by the fixation of numerous beneficial mutations, as revealed by signatures of positive directional selection in the genome (selective sweeps). The estimated rate of adaptive substitution on the X chromosome is in the order of 10(-11) per nucleotide site per generation. Comparable (but not significantly higher) substitution rates are found in derived populations that colonized new habitats outside Africa, such as in a European population that branched off from the African lineage about 16,000 ya.},

Here we present evidence that a population from Zimbabwe is more than twice as variable as those from the United States of America at the DNA sequence level, that most variants are not shared between the two geographic regions, and that there are nearly fixed differences between the Zimbabwe and USA samples in genomic regions experiencing low recombination rates.

	Abstract = {Genome-wide nucleotide variation in non-African populations of Drosophila melanogaster is a subset of variation found in East sub-Saharan African populations, suggesting a bottleneck in the history of the former. We implement an approximate Bayesian approach to infer the timing, duration, and severity of this putative bottleneck and ask whether this inferred model is sufficient to account for patterns of variability observed at 115 loci scattered across the X chromosome. We estimate a recent bottleneck 0.006N(e) generations ago, somewhat further in the past than suggested by biogeographical evidence. Using various proposed statistical tests, we find that this bottleneck model is able to predict the majority of observed features of diversity and linkage disequilibrium in the data. Thus, while precise estimates of bottleneck parameters (like inferences of selection) are sensitive to model assumptions, our results imply that it may be unnecessary to invoke frequent selective sweeps associated with the dispersal of D. melanogaster from Africa to explain patterns of variability in non-African populations.},

@article{Haddrilletal2005,
	Abstract = {Uncertainty about the demographic history of populations can hamper genome-wide scans for selection based on population genetic models. To obtain a portrait of the effects of demographic history on genome variability patterns in Drosophila melanogaster populations, we surveyed noncoding DNA polymorphism at 10 X-linked loci in large samples from three African and two non-African populations. All five populations show significant departures from expectations under the standard neutral model. We detect weak but significant differentiation between East (Kenya and Zimbabwe) and West/Central sub-Saharan (Gabon) African populations. A skew toward high-frequency-derived polymorphisms, elevated levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and significant heterogeneity in levels of polymorphism and divergence in the Gabon sample suggest that this population is further from mutation-drift equilibrium than the two Eastern African populations. Both non-African populations harbor significantly higher levels of LD, a large excess of high-frequency-derived mutations and extreme heterogeneity among loci in levels of polymorphism and divergence. Rejections of the neutral model in D. melanogaster populations using these and similar features have been interpreted as evidence for an important role for natural selection in shaping genome variability patterns. Based on simulations, we conclude that simple bottleneck models are sufficient to account for most, if not all, polymorphism features of both African and non-African populations. In contrast, we show that a steady-state recurrent hitchhiking model fails to account for several aspects of the data. Demographic departures from equilibrium expectations in both ancestral and derived populations thus represent a serious challenge to detecting positive selection in genome-wide scans using current methodologies.},

	Abstract = {Post-transcriptional editing of pre-mRNAs through the action of dsRNA adenosine deaminases results in the modification of particular adenosine (A) residues to inosine (I), which can alter the coding potential of the modified transcripts. We describe here three sites in the para transcript, which encodes the major voltage-activated Na(+) channel polypeptide in Drosophila, where RNA editing occurs. The occurrence of RNA editing at the three sites was found to be developmentally regulated. Editing at two of these sites was also conserved across species between the D. melanogaster and D. virilis. In each case, a highly conserved region was found in the intron downstream of the editing site and this region was shown to be complementary to the region of the exonic editing site. Thus, editing at these sites would appear to involve a mechanism whereby the edited exon forms a base-paired secondary structure with the distant conserved noncoding sequences located in adjacent downstream introns, similar to the mechanism shown for A-to-I RNA editing of mammalian glutamate receptor subunits (GluRs). For the third site, neither RNA editing nor the predicted RNA secondary structures were evolutionarily conserved. Transcripts from transgenic Drosophila expressing a minimal editing site construct for this site were shown to faithfully undergo RNA editing. These results demonstrate that Na(+) channel diversity in Drosophila is increased by RNA editing via a mechanism analogous to that described for transcripts encoding mammalian GluRs.},

	Abstract = {Antisense RNA may regulate the expression of a number of eukaryotic genes, but little is known about its prevalence or mechanism of action. We have used a model system in which antisense control can be studied both genetically and biochemically. Late in polyoma virus infection, early-strand mRNA levels are down-regulated by nuclear antisense RNA from the late strand. Analysis of early-strand transcripts isolated late in infection revealed extensive base modifications. In many transcripts almost half of the adenosines were altered to inosines or guanosines. These results suggest modification of RNA duplexes by double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase or a related enzyme. Probes that detect only modified RNAs revealed that these molecules are not highly unstable, but accumulate within the nucleus and are thus inert for gene expression. Antisense-induced modifications can account for most or all of the observed regulation, with the lowered levels of early-strand RNAs commonly observed late in infection resulting from the fact that many transcripts are invisible to standard hybridization probes. This work suggests that similar antisense-mediated control mechanisms may also operate under physiological conditions in uninfected eukaryotic cells, and leads to the proposal that there is a novel pool of nuclear RNAs that cannot be seen with many molecular probes heretofore used.},

	Abstract = {An activity that unwinds double-stranded RNA has been reported to exist in several organisms. We have analyzed the RNA intermediates and final products of the unwinding reaction. Although the RNA becomes sensitive to single strand-specific ribonucleases during the reaction, the duplex is never completely unwound. Furthermore, the base pairing properties of the RNA are permanently altered; the reacted RNA cannot rehybridize to form the original duplex. We demonstrate that during the reaction many, but not all, of the adenosine residues are converted to inosine residues, and we propose that the covalent modification is responsible for the irreversible change in base pairing properties. Possible biological roles for the unwinding/modifying activity, as well as its relevance to antisense RNA experiments, are discussed.},

In the intervening decade, research on dsRAD has progressed not only predictably, such as with the purification of the enzyme and identification of cDNAs, but also in some quite surprising ways. This review covers both areas of progress, but will concentrate on the surprises, which include the discovery that dsRAD is a member of a larger family of deaminases and the identification of RNAs that appear to be targets for these deaminases in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Recent genomic sequencing of 10 additional Drosophila genomes provides a rich resource for comparative genomics analyses aimed at understanding the similarities and differences between species and between Drosophila and mammals. Using a phylogenetic approach, we identified 64 genomic elements that have been highly conserved over most of the Drosophila tree, but that have experienced a recent burst of evolution along the Drosophila melanogaster lineage. Compared to similarly defined elements in humans, these regions of rapid lineage-specific evolution in Drosophila differ dramatically in location, mechanism of evolution, and functional properties of associated genes. Notably, the majority reside in protein-coding regions and primarily result from rapid adaptive synonymous site evolution. In fact, adaptive evolution appears to be driving substitutions to unpreferred codons. Our analysis also highlights interesting noncoding genomic regions, such as regulatory regions in the gene gooseberry-neuro and a putative novel miRNA.},

	Abstract = {Changes in gene regulation are thought to have contributed to the evolution of human development. However, in vivo evidence for uniquely human developmental regulatory function has remained elusive. In transgenic mice, a conserved noncoding sequence (HACNS1) that evolved extremely rapidly in humans acted as an enhancer of gene expression that has gained a strong limb expression domain relative to the orthologous elements from chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. This gain of function was consistent across two developmental stages in the mouse and included the presumptive anterior wrist and proximal thumb. In vivo analyses with synthetic enhancers, in which human-specific substitutions were introduced into the chimpanzee enhancer sequence or reverted in the human enhancer to the ancestral state, indicated that 13 substitutions clustered in an 81-base pair module otherwise highly constrained among terrestrial vertebrates were sufficient to confer the human-specific limb expression domain.},

	Abstract = {Changes in gene regulation likely influenced the profound phenotypic divergence of humans from other mammals, but the extent of adaptive substitution in human regulatory sequences remains unknown. We identified 992 conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) with a significant excess of human-specific substitutions. These accelerated elements were disproportionately found near genes involved in neuronal cell adhesion. To assess the uniqueness of human noncoding evolution, we examined CNSs accelerated in chimpanzee and mouse. Although we observed a similar enrichment near neuronal adhesion genes in chimpanzee, the accelerated CNSs themselves exhibited almost no overlap with those in human, suggesting independent evolution toward different neuronal phenotypes in each species. CNSs accelerated in mouse showed no bias toward neuronal cell adhesion. Our results indicate that widespread cis-regulatory changes in human evolution may have contributed to uniquely human features of brain development and function.},

	Abstract = {In a recent study that identified highly evolutionary conserved sequences in three genomes of Diptera species we described an ultraconserved element found at an internal exon-intron junction of the Drosophila melanogaster homothorax (hth) gene that appeared to be involved in the control of hth pre-mRNA splicing. We also discussed a possible role of RNA secondary structure at this site in the regulation of hth pre-mRNA splicing. In this report we identify a shorter evolutionary conserved intronic element within the hth gene that is located downstream of the first element and has sequence complementarity to it. We demonstrate that intramolecular interactions between these two elements would give rise to alternative RNA secondary structures, which in turn may result in differential control of homothorax pre-mRNA splicing. We also provide additional comparative genomic data from several newly available insect genomes supporting our original conclusion that these conserved elements are important in the post-transcriptional regulation of homothorax gene expression in Diptera.},

	Abstract = {Recently, we identified a large number of ultraconserved (uc) sequences in noncoding regions of human, mouse, and rat genomes that appear to be essential for vertebrate and amniote ontogeny. Here, we used similar methods to identify ultraconserved genomic regions between the insect species Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, as well as the more distantly related Anopheles gambiae. As with vertebrates, ultraconserved sequences in insects appear to occur primarily in intergenic and intronic sequences, and at intron-exon junctions. The sequences are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators and transcription factors, but are less frequent and are smaller in size than in vertebrates. The longest identical, nongapped orthologous match between the three genomes was found within the homothorax (hth) gene. This sequence spans an internal exon-intron junction, with the majority located within the intron, and is predicted to form a highly stable stem-loop RNA structure. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of different hth splice isoforms and Northern blotting showed that the conserved element is associated with a high incidence of intron retention in hth pre-mRNA, suggesting that the conserved intronic element is critically important in the post-transcriptional regulation of hth expression in Diptera.},

	Abstract = {The majority of metazoan genomes consist of nonprotein-coding regions, although the functional significance of most noncoding DNA sequences remains unknown. Highly conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) have proven to be reliable indicators of functionally constrained sequences such as cis-regulatory elements and noncoding RNA genes. However, CNSs may arise from nonselective evolutionary processes such as genomic regions with extremely low mutation rates known as mutation "cold spots." Here we combine comparative genomic data from recently completed insect genome projects with population genetic data in Drosophila melanogaster to test predictions of the mutational cold spot model of CNS evolution in the genus Drosophila. We find that point mutations in intronic and intergenic CNSs exhibit a significant reduction in levels of divergence relative to levels of polymorphism, as well as a significant excess of rare derived alleles, compared with either the nonconserved spacer regions between CNSs or with 4-fold silent sites in coding regions. Controlling for the effects of purifying selection, we find no evidence of positive selection acting on Drosophila CNSs, although we do find evidence for the action of recurrent positive selection in the spacer regions between CNSs. We estimate that approximately 85% of sites in Drosophila CNSs are under constraint with selection coefficients (N(e)s) on the order of 10-100, and thus, the estimated strength and number of sites under purifying selection is greater for Drosophila CNSs relative to those in the human genome. These patterns of nonneutral molecular evolution are incompatible with the mutational cold spot hypothesis to explain the existence of CNSs in Drosophila and, coupled with similar findings in mammals, argue against the general likelihood that CNSs are generated by mutational cold spots in any metazoan genome.},

	Abstract = {Polycomb group proteins are essential for early development in metazoans, but their contributions to human development are not well understood. We have mapped the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) subunit SUZ12 across the entire nonrepeat portion of the genome in human embryonic stem (ES) cells. We found that SUZ12 is distributed across large portions of over two hundred genes encoding key developmental regulators. These genes are occupied by nucleosomes trimethylated at histone H3K27, are transcriptionally repressed, and contain some of the most highly conserved noncoding elements in the genome. We found that PRC2 target genes are preferentially activated during ES cell differentiation and that the ES cell regulators OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG cooccupy a significant subset of these genes. These results indicate that PRC2 occupies a special set of developmental genes in ES cells that must be repressed to maintain pluripotency and that are poised for activation during ES cell differentiation.},

@article{Bernsteinetal2006,
	Abstract = {The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed "bivalent domains," consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency.},

@article{CarterDurbin2006,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: One way in which the accuracy of gene structure prediction in vertebrate DNA sequences can be improved is by analyzing alignments with multiple related species, since functional regions of genes tend to be more conserved. RESULTS: We describe DOGFISH, a vertebrate gene finder consisting of a cleanly separated site classifier and structure predictor. The classifier scores potential splice sites and other features, using sequence alignments between multiple vertebrate species, while the structure predictor hypothesizes coding transcripts by combining these scores using a simple model of gene structure. This also identifies and assigns confidence scores to possible additional exons. Performance is assessed on the ENCODE regions. We predict transcripts and exons across the whole human genome, and identify over 10,000 high confidence new coding exons not in the Ensembl gene set. CONCLUSION: We present a practical multiple species gene prediction method. Accuracy improves as additional species, up to at least eight, are introduced. The novel predictions of the whole-genome scan should support efficient experimental verification.},

	Abstract = {We report the generation and analysis of functional data from multiple, diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1% of the human genome as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome function.},

	Abstract = {We identified a previously unknown riboswitch class in bacteria that is selectively triggered by glycine. A representative of these glycine-sensing RNAs from Bacillus subtilis operates as a rare genetic on switch for the gcvT operon, which codes for proteins that form the glycine cleavage system. Most glycine riboswitches integrate two ligand-binding domains that function cooperatively to more closely approximate a two-state genetic switch. This advanced form of riboswitch may have evolved to ensure that excess glycine is efficiently used to provide carbon flux through the citric acid cycle and maintain adequate amounts of the amino acid for protein synthesis. Thus, riboswitches perform key regulatory roles and exhibit complex performance characteristics that previously had been observed only with protein factors.},

	Abstract = {The discoveries of microRNAs and riboswitches, among others, have shown functional RNAs to be biologically more important and genomically more prevalent than previously anticipated. We have developed a general comparative genomics method based on phylogenetic stochastic context-free grammars for identifying functional RNAs encoded in the human genome and used it to survey an eight-way genome-wide alignment of the human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, chicken, zebra-fish, and puffer-fish genomes for deeply conserved functional RNAs. At a loose threshold for acceptance, this search resulted in a set of 48,479 candidate RNA structures. This screen finds a large number of known functional RNAs, including 195 miRNAs, 62 histone 3'UTR stem loops, and various types of known genetic recoding elements. Among the highest-scoring new predictions are 169 new miRNA candidates, as well as new candidate selenocysteine insertion sites, RNA editing hairpins, RNAs involved in transcript auto regulation, and many folds that form singletons or small functional RNA families of completely unknown function. While the rate of false positives in the overall set is difficult to estimate and is likely to be substantial, the results nevertheless provide evidence for many new human functional RNAs and present specific predictions to facilitate their further characterization.},

Discovery of these edited transcripts has always been serendipitous. Using comparative genomics, we identified a phylogenetic signature of RNA editing. We report the identification and experimental verification of 16 previously unknown ADAR target genes in the fruit fly Drosophila and one in humans-more than the sum total previously reported. All of these genes are involved in rapid electrical and chemical neurotransmission, and many of the edited sites recode conserved and functionally important amino acids. These results point to a pivotal role for RNA editing in nervous system function.},

@article{12Genomes,
	Abstract = {Comparative analysis of multiple genomes in a phylogenetic framework dramatically improves the precision and sensitivity of evolutionary inference, producing more robust results than single-genome analyses can provide. The genomes of 12 Drosophila species, ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of these diverse species.},

	Abstract = {Ultraconserved elements have been suggested to retain extended perfect sequence identity between the human, mouse, and rat genomes due to essential functional properties. To investigate the necessities of these elements in vivo, we removed four noncoding ultraconserved elements (ranging in length from 222 to 731 base pairs) from the mouse genome. To maximize the likelihood of observing a phenotype, we chose to delete elements that function as enhancers in a mouse transgenic assay and that are near genes that exhibit marked phenotypes both when completely inactivated in the mouse and when their expression is altered due to other genomic modifications. Remarkably, all four resulting lines of mice lacking these ultraconserved elements were viable and fertile, and failed to reveal any critical abnormalities when assayed for a variety of phenotypes including growth, longevity, pathology, and metabolism. In addition, more targeted screens, informed by the abnormalities observed in mice in which genes in proximity to the investigated elements had been altered, also failed to reveal notable abnormalities. These results, while not inclusive of all the possible phenotypic impact of the deleted sequences, indicate that extreme sequence constraint does not necessarily reflect crucial functions required for viability.},

	Abstract = {Increasingly powerful sequencing technologies are ushering in an era of personal genome sequences and raising the possibility of using such information to guide medical decisions. Genome resequencing also promises to accelerate the identification of disease-associated mutations. Roughly 98% of the human genome is composed of repeats and intergenic or non-protein-coding sequences. Thus, it is crucial to focus resequencing on high-value genomic regions. Protein-coding exons represent one such type of high-value target. We have developed a method of using flexible, high-density microarrays to capture any desired fraction of the human genome, in this case corresponding to more than 200,000 protein-coding exons. Depending on the precise protocol, up to 55-85% of the captured fragments are associated with targeted regions and up to 98% of intended exons can be recovered. This methodology provides an adaptable route toward rapid and efficient resequencing of any sizeable, non-repeat portion of the human genome.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Our understanding of gene regulation is currently limited by our ability to collectively synthesize and catalogue transcriptional regulatory elements stored in scientific literature. Over the past decade, this task has become increasingly challenging as the accrual of biologically validated regulatory sequences has accelerated. To meet this challenge, novel community-based approaches to regulatory element annotation are required. SUMMARY: Here, we present the Open Regulatory Annotation (ORegAnno) database as a dynamic collection of literature-curated regulatory regions, transcription factor binding sites and regulatory mutations (polymorphisms and haplotypes). ORegAnno has been designed to manage the submission, indexing and validation of new annotations from users worldwide. Submissions to ORegAnno are immediately cross-referenced to EnsEMBL, dbSNP, Entrez Gene, the NCBI Taxonomy database and PubMed, where appropriate. AVAILABILITY: ORegAnno is available directly through MySQL, Web services, and online at http://www.oreganno.org. All software is licensed under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL).},

We have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the approximately 120-megabase euchromatic portion of the Drosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map. Efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps; however, the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation.

	Abstract = {A large fraction of eukaryotic genomes consists of DNA that is not translated into protein sequence, and little is known about its functional significance. Here I show that several classes of non-coding DNA in Drosophila are evolving considerably slower than synonymous sites, and yet show an excess of between-species divergence relative to polymorphism when compared with synonymous sites. The former is a hallmark of selective constraint, but the latter is a signature of adaptive evolution, resembling general patterns of protein evolution in Drosophila. I estimate that about 40-70% of nucleotides in intergenic regions, untranslated portions of mature mRNAs (UTRs) and most intronic DNA are evolutionarily constrained relative to synonymous sites. However, I also use an extension to the McDonald-Kreitman test to show that a substantial fraction of the nucleotide divergence in these regions was driven to fixation by positive selection (about 20% for most intronic and intergenic DNA, and 60% for UTRs). On the basis of these observations, I suggest that a large fraction of the non-translated genome is functionally important and subject to both purifying selection and adaptive evolution. These results imply that, although positive selection is clearly an important facet of protein evolution, adaptive changes to non-coding DNA might have been considerably more common in the evolution of D. melanogaster.},

Repeated bouts of hitchhiking are thought to lower X-linked diversity for two reasons: first, because sojourn times of beneficial mutations are shorter on the X, and second, because adaptive substitutions may be more frequent on the X. We investigate whether each of these effects does, in fact, cause reduced X-linked diversity under hitchhiking. We study the strength of the hitchhiking effect on the X vs. autosomes when there is no recombination and under two different recombination schemes. When recombination occurs in both sexes, X-linked vs. autosomal diversity is reduced by hitchhiking under a broad range of conditions, but when there is no recombination in males, as in Drosophila, the required conditions are considerably more restrictive.},

	Abstract = {Descriptions of recently evolved genes suggest several mechanisms of origin including exon shuffling, gene fission/fusion, retrotransposition, duplication-divergence, and lateral gene transfer, all of which involve recruitment of preexisting genes or genetic elements into new function. The importance of noncoding DNA in the origin of novel genes remains an open question. We used the well annotated genome of the genetic model system Drosophila melanogaster and genome sequences of related species to carry out a whole-genome search for new D. melanogaster genes that are derived from noncoding DNA. Here, we describe five such genes, four of which are X-linked. Our RT-PCR experiments show that all five putative novel genes are expressed predominantly in testes. These data support the idea that these novel genes are derived from ancestral noncoding sequence and that new, favored genes are likely to invade populations under selective pressures relating to male reproduction.},

	Abstract = {The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is an abundant primate species that diverged from the ancestors of Homo sapiens about 25 million years ago. Because they are genetically and physiologically similar to humans, rhesus monkeys are the most widely used nonhuman primate in basic and applied biomedical research. We determined the genome sequence of an Indian-origin Macaca mulatta female and compared the data with chimpanzees and humans to reveal the structure of ancestral primate genomes and to identify evidence for positive selection and lineage-specific expansions and contractions of gene families. A comparison of sequences from individual animals was used to investigate their underlying genetic diversity. The complete description of the macaque genome blueprint enhances the utility of this animal model for biomedical research and improves our understanding of the basic biology of the species.},

	Abstract = {We report the generation and analysis of functional data from multiple, diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1% of the human genome as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome function.},

	Abstract = {The mutational origin and subsequent evolution of de novo genes, which are hypothesized to be genes of recent origin that are not obviously related to ancestral coding sequence, are poorly understood. However, accumulating evidence suggests that such genes may often function in male reproduction. Here we use testis-derived expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from Drosophila yakuba to identify genes that have likely arisen either in D. yakuba or in the D. yakuba/D. erecta ancestor. We found several such genes, which show testis-biased expression and are often X-linked. Comparative data indicate that three of these genes have very short open reading frames, which suggests the possibility that a significant number of testis-biased de novo genes in the D. yakuba/D. erecta clade may be noncoding RNA genes. These data, along with previously published data from D. melanogaster, support the idea that many de novo Drosophila genes function in male reproduction and that a small region of the X chromosome in the melanogaster subgroup may be a hotspot for the evolution of novel testis-biased genes.},

	Abstract = {When two samples of DNA sequences are compared, one way in which they may differ is in the presence of fixed differences, which are defined as sites at which all of the sequences in one sample are different from all of the sequences in a second sample. The probability distribution of the number of fixed differences is developed. The theory employs Wright-Fisher genealogies and the infinite sites mutation model. For the case when both samples are drawn randomly from the same population it is found that genealogies permitting fixed differences are very unlikely. Thus the mere presence of fixed differences between samples is statistically significant, even for small samples. The theory is extended to samples from populations that have been separated for some time. The relationship between a simple Poisson distribution of mutations and the distribution of fixed differences is described as a function of the time since populations have been isolated. It is shown how these results may contribute to improved tests of recent balancing or directional selection.},

Here we report a public database of common variation in the human genome: more than one million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for which accurate and complete genotypes have been obtained in 269 DNA samples from four populations, including ten 500-kilobase regions in which essentially all information about common DNA variation has been extracted. These data document the generality of recombination hotspots, a block-like structure of linkage disequilibrium and low haplotype diversity, leading to substantial correlations of SNPs with many of their neighbours. We show how the HapMap resource can guide the design and analysis of genetic association studies, shed light on structural variation and recombination, and identify loci that may have been subject to natural selection during human evolution.},

	Abstract = {Most of the available SNP data have eluded valid population genetic analysis because most population genetical methods do not correctly accommodate the special discovery process used to identify SNPs. Most of the available SNP data have allele frequency distributions that are biased by the ascertainment protocol. We here show how this problem can be corrected by obtaining maximum-likelihood estimates of the true allele frequency distribution. In simple cases, the ML estimate of the true allele frequency distribution can be obtained analytically, but in other cases computational methods based on numerical optimization or the EM algorithm must be used. We illustrate the new correction method by analyzing some previously published SNP data from the SNP Consortium. Appropriate treatment of SNP ascertainment is vital to our ability to make correct inferences from the data of the International HapMap Project.},

	Abstract = {Genes responsible for human-specific phenotypes may have been under altered selective pressures in human evolution and thus exhibit changes in substitution rate and pattern at the protein sequence level. Using comparative analysis of human, chimpanzee, and mouse protein sequences, we identified two genes (PRM2 and FOXP2) with significantly enhanced evolutionary rates in the hominid lineage. PRM2 is a histone-like protein essential to spermatogenesis and was previously reported to be a likely target of sexual selection in humans and chimpanzees. FOXP2 is a transcription factor involved in speech and language development. Human FOXP2 experienced a >60-fold increase in substitution rate and incorporated two fixed amino acid changes in a broadly defined transcription suppression domain. A survey of a diverse group of placental mammals reveals the uniqueness of the human FOXP2 sequence and a population genetic analysis indicates possible adaptive selection behind the accelerated evolution. Taken together, our results suggest an important role that FOXP2 may have played in the origin of human speech and demonstrate a strategy for identifying candidate genes underlying the emergences of human-specific features.},

	Abstract = {Comparisons of DNA polymorphism within species to divergence between species enables the discovery of molecular adaptation in evolutionarily constrained genes as well as the differentiation of weak from strong purifying selection. The extent to which weak negative and positive darwinian selection have driven the molecular evolution of different species varies greatly, with some species, such as Drosophila melanogaster, showing strong evidence of pervasive positive selection, and others, such as the selfing weed Arabidopsis thaliana, showing an excess of deleterious variation within local populations. Here we contrast patterns of coding sequence polymorphism identified by direct sequencing of 39 humans for over 11,000 genes to divergence between humans and chimpanzees, and find strong evidence that natural selection has shaped the recent molecular evolution of our species. Our analysis discovered 304 (9.0%) out of 3,377 potentially informative loci showing evidence of rapid amino acid evolution. Furthermore, 813 (13.5%) out of 6,033 potentially informative loci show a paucity of amino acid differences between humans and chimpanzees, indicating weak negative selection and/or balancing selection operating on mutations at these loci. We find that the distribution of negatively and positively selected genes varies greatly among biological processes and molecular functions, and that some classes, such as transcription factors, show an excess of rapidly evolving genes, whereas others, such as cytoskeletal proteins, show an excess of genes with extensive amino acid polymorphism within humans and yet little amino acid divergence between humans and chimpanzees.},

	Abstract = {A population can adapt to a rapid environmental change or habitat expansion in two ways. It may adapt either through new beneficial mutations that subsequently sweep through the population or by using alleles from the standing genetic variation. We use diffusion theory to calculate the probabilities for selective adaptations and find a large increase in the fixation probability for weak substitutions, if alleles originate from the standing genetic variation. We then determine the parameter regions where each scenario-standing variation vs. new mutations-is more likely. Adaptations from the standing genetic variation are favored if either the selective advantage is weak or the selection coefficient and the mutation rate are both high. Finally, we analyze the probability of "soft sweeps," where multiple copies of the selected allele contribute to a substitution, and discuss the consequences for the footprint of selection on linked neutral variation. We find that soft sweeps with weaker selective footprints are likely under both scenarios if the mutation rate and/or the selection coefficient is high.},

	Abstract = {In the classical model of molecular adaptation, a favored allele derives from a single mutational origin. This ignores that beneficial alleles can enter a population recurrently, either by mutation or migration, during the selective phase. In this case, descendants of several of these independent origins may contribute to the fixation. As a consequence, all ancestral haplotypes that are linked to any of these copies will be retained in the population, affecting the pattern of a selective sweep on linked neutral variation. In this study, we use analytical calculations based on coalescent theory and computer simulations to analyze molecular adaptation from recurrent mutation or migration. Under the assumption of complete linkage, we derive a robust analytical approximation for the number of ancestral haplotypes and their distribution in a sample from the population. We find that so-called "soft sweeps," where multiple ancestral haplotypes appear in a sample, are likely for biologically realistic values of mutation or migration rates.},

	Abstract = {The allele frequency spectrum of polymorphisms in DNA sequences can be used to test for signatures of natural selection that depart from the expected frequency spectrum under the neutral theory. We observed a significant (P = 0.001) correlation between the Tajima's D test statistic in full resequencing data and Tajima's D in a dense, genome-wide data set of genotyped polymorphisms for a set of 179 genes. Based on this, we used a sliding window analysis of Tajima's D across the human genome to identify regions putatively subject to strong, recent, selective sweeps. This survey identified seven Contiguous Regions of Tajima's D Reduction (CRTRs) in an African-descent population (AD), 23 in a European-descent population (ED), and 29 in a Chinese-descent population (XD). Only four CRTRs overlapped between populations: three between ED and XD and one between AD and ED. Full resequencing of eight genes within six CRTRs demonstrated frequency spectra inconsistent with neutral expectations for at least one gene within each CRTR. Identification of the functional polymorphism (and/or haplotype) responsible for the selective sweeps within each CRTR may provide interesting insights into the strongest selective pressures experienced by the human genome over recent evolutionary history.},

	Abstract = {Identifying regions of the human genome that have been targets of positive selection will provide important insights into recent human evolutionary history and may facilitate the search for complex disease genes. However, the confounding effects of population demographic history and selection on patterns of genetic variation complicate inferences of selection when a small number of loci are studied. To this end, identifying outlier loci from empirical genome-wide distributions of genetic variation is a promising strategy to detect targets of selection. Here, we evaluate the power and efficiency of a simple outlier approach and describe a genome-wide scan for positive selection using a dense catalog of 1.58 million SNPs that were genotyped in three human populations. In total, we analyzed 14,589 genes, 385 of which possess patterns of genetic variation consistent with the hypothesis of positive selection. Furthermore, several extended genomic regions were found, spanning >500 kb, that contained multiple contiguous candidate selection genes. More generally, these data provide important practical insights into the limits of outlier approaches in genome-wide scans for selection, provide strong candidate selection genes to study in greater detail, and may have important implications for disease related research.},

	Abstract = {The abundance of cis-regulatory polymorphisms in humans suggests that many may have been important in human evolution, but evidence for their role is relatively rare. Four common polymorphisms in the 5' promoter region of factor VII (F7), a coagulation factor, have been shown to affect its transcription and protein abundance both in vitro and in vivo. Three of these polymorphisms have low-frequency alleles that decrease expression of F7 and may provide protection against myocardial infarction (heart attacks). The fourth polymorphism has a minor allele that increases the level of transcription. To look for evidence of natural selection on the cis-regulatory variants flanking F7, we genotyped three of the polymorphisms in six Old World populations for which we also have data from a group of putatively neutral SNPs. Our population genetic analysis shows evidence for selection within humans; surprisingly, the strongest evidence is due to a large increase in frequency of the high-expression variant in Singaporean Chinese. Further characterization of a Japanese population shows that at least part of the increase in frequency of the high-expression allele is found in other East Asian populations. In addition, to examine interspecific patterns of selection we sequenced the homologous 5' noncoding region in chimpanzees, bonobos, a gorilla, an orangutan, and a baboon. Analysis of these data reveals an excess of fixed differences within transcription factor binding sites along the human lineage. Our results thus further support the hypothesis that regulatory mutations have been important in human evolution.},

	Abstract = {Changes in the cis-regulation of neural genes likely contributed to the evolution of our species' unique attributes, but evidence of a role for natural selection has been lacking. We found that positive natural selection altered the cis-regulation of human prodynorphin, the precursor molecule for a suite of endogenous opioids and neuropeptides with critical roles in regulating perception, behavior, and memory. Independent lines of phylogenetic and population genetic evidence support a history of selective sweeps driving the evolution of the human prodynorphin promoter. In experimental assays of chimpanzee-human hybrid promoters, the selected sequence increases transcriptional inducibility. The evidence for a change in the response of the brain's natural opioids to inductive stimuli points to potential human-specific characteristics favored during evolution. In addition, the pattern of linked nucleotide and microsatellite variation among and within modern human populations suggests that recent selection, subsequent to the fixation of the human-specific mutations and the peopling of the globe, has favored different prodynorphin cis-regulatory alleles in different parts of the world.},

	Abstract = {A correlation between diversity levels and rates of recombination is predicted both by models of positive selection, such as hitchhiking associated with the rapid fixation of advantageous mutations, and by models of purifying selection against strongly deleterious mutations (commonly referred to as "background selection"). With parameter values appropriate for Drosophila populations, only the first class of models predicts a marked skew in the frequency spectrum of linked neutral variants, relative to a neutral model. Here, we consider 29 loci scattered throughout the Drosophila melanogaster genome. We show that, in African populations, a summary of the frequency spectrum of polymorphic mutations is positively correlated with the meiotic rate of crossing over. This pattern is demonstrated to be unlikely under a model of background selection. Models of weakly deleterious selection are not expected to produce both the observed correlation and the extent to which nucleotide diversity is reduced in regions of low (but nonzero) recombination. Thus, of existing models, hitchhiking due to the recurrent fixation of advantageous variants is the most plausible explanation for the data.},

	Abstract = {Language is a uniquely human trait likely to have been a prerequisite for the development of human culture. The ability to develop articulate speech relies on capabilities, such as fine control of the larynx and mouth, that are absent in chimpanzees and other great apes. FOXP2 is the first gene relevant to the human ability to develop language. A point mutation in FOXP2 co-segregates with a disorder in a family in which half of the members have severe articulation difficulties accompanied by linguistic and grammatical impairment. This gene is disrupted by translocation in an unrelated individual who has a similar disorder. Thus, two functional copies of FOXP2 seem to be required for acquisition of normal spoken language. We sequenced the complementary DNAs that encode the FOXP2 protein in the chimpanzee, gorilla, orang-utan, rhesus macaque and mouse, and compared them with the human cDNA. We also investigated intraspecific variation of the human FOXP2 gene. Here we show that human FOXP2 contains changes in amino-acid coding and a pattern of nucleotide polymorphism, which strongly suggest that this gene has been the target of selection during recent human evolution.},

	Abstract = {The fixation of a beneficial allele in a population leaves a well-characterized signature in patterns of nucleotide variation at linked sites. This signature can be used to estimate the time since fixation from patterns of polymorphism in extant individuals. I introduce a method to assess the support in polymorphism data for a recent episode of directional positive selection and to estimate the time since fixation. I summarize the polymorphism data by three statistics that carry information about levels of diversity, the allele frequency spectrum, and the extent of allelic associations. Simulations are then used to obtain a sample from the posterior distribution of the time since fixation, conditional on the observed summaries. I test the performance of the approach on simulated data and apply it to the gene tb1 in maize. The data support the recent fixation of a favored allele, consistent with what is known about the importance of tb1 in the domestication process of maize.},

	Abstract = {In Drosophila and humans, there are accumulating examples of loci with a significant excess of high-frequency-derived alleles or high levels of linkage disequilibrium, relative to a neutral model of a random-mating population of constant size. These are features expected after a recent selective sweep. Their prevalence suggests that positive directional selection may be widespread in both species. However, as I show here, these features do not persist long after the sweep ends: The high-frequency alleles drift to fixation and no longer contribute to polymorphism, while linkage disequilibrium is broken down by recombination. As a result, loci chosen without independent evidence of recent selection are not expected to exhibit either of these features, even if they have been affected by numerous sweeps in their genealogical history. How then can we explain the patterns in the data? One possibility is population structure, with unequal sampling from different subpopulations. Alternatively, positive selection may not operate as is commonly modeled. In particular, the rate of fixation of advantageous mutations may have increased in the recent past.},

	Abstract = {We analyze patterns of nucleotide variability at 15 X-linked loci and 14 autosomal loci from a North American population of Drosophila simulans. We show that there is significantly more linkage disequilibrium on the X chromosome than on chromosome arm 3R and much more linkage disequilibrium on both chromosomes than expected from estimates of recombination rates, mutation rates, and levels of diversity. To explore what types of evolutionary models might explain this observation, we examine a model of recurrent, nonoverlapping selective sweeps and a model of a recent drastic bottleneck (e.g., founder event) in the demographic history of North American populations of D. simulans. The simple sweep model is not consistent with the observed patterns of linkage disequilibrium nor with the observed frequencies of segregating mutations. Under a restricted range of parameter values, a simple bottleneck model is consistent with multiple facets of the data. While our results do not exclude some influence of selection on X vs. autosome variability levels, they suggest that demography alone may account for patterns of linkage disequilibrium and the frequency spectrum of segregating mutations in this population of D. simulans.},

	Abstract = {Identifying the sequences that direct the spatial and temporal expression of genes and defining their function in vivo remains a significant challenge in the annotation of vertebrate genomes. One major obstacle is the lack of experimentally validated training sets. In this study, we made use of extreme evolutionary sequence conservation as a filter to identify putative gene regulatory elements, and characterized the in vivo enhancer activity of a large group of non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved in human-pufferfish, Takifugu (Fugu) rubripes, or ultraconserved in human-mouse-rat. We tested 167 of these extremely conserved sequences in a transgenic mouse enhancer assay. Here we report that 45% of these sequences functioned reproducibly as tissue-specific enhancers of gene expression at embryonic day 11.5. While directing expression in a broad range of anatomical structures in the embryo, the majority of the 75 enhancers directed expression to various regions of the developing nervous system. We identified sequence signatures enriched in a subset of these elements that targeted forebrain expression, and used these features to rank all approximately 3,100 non-coding elements in the human genome that are conserved between human and Fugu. The testing of the top predictions in transgenic mice resulted in a threefold enrichment for sequences with forebrain enhancer activity. These data dramatically expand the catalogue of human gene enhancers that have been characterized in vivo, and illustrate the utility of such training sets for a variety of biological applications, including decoding the regulatory vocabulary of the human genome.},

We propose that genetic individuality is largely shaped by the combinatory shuffling of a modest number of genes, each of which exists as a family of functionally and structurally diverged alleles. Unequivocal examples of such allele families are found at the O-antigen-biosynthetic locus in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the human leucocyte antigen locus in humans. We examine characteristic features of these allele families and explore the possibility that genetic loci with similar characteristics can be recognized in a whole-genome scan of human genetic variation.},

	Abstract = {Most proteins do not evolve in isolation, but as components of complex genetic networks. Therefore, a protein's position in a network may indicate how central it is to cellular function and, hence, how constrained it is evolutionarily. To look for an effect of position on evolutionary rate, we examined the protein-protein interaction networks in three eukaryotes: yeast, worm, and fly. We find that the three networks have remarkably similar structure, such that the number of interactors per protein and the centrality of proteins in the networks have similar distributions. Proteins that have a more central position in all three networks, regardless of the number of direct interactors, evolve more slowly and are more likely to be essential for survival. Our results are thus consistent with a classic proposal of Fisher's that pleiotropy constrains evolution.},

	Abstract = {The function of protein and RNA molecules depends on complex epistatic interactions between sites. Therefore, the deleterious effect of a mutation can be suppressed by a compensatory second-site substitution. In relating a list of 86 pathogenic mutations in human tRNAs encoded by mitochondrial genes to the sequences of their mammalian orthologs, we noted that 52 pathogenic mutations were present in normal tRNAs of one or several nonhuman mammals. We found at least five mechanisms of compensation for 32 pathogenic mutations that destroyed a Watson-Crick pair in one of the four tRNA stems: restoration of the affected Watson-Crick interaction (25 cases), strengthening of another pair (4 cases), creation of a new pair (8 cases), changes of multiple interactions in the affected stem (11 cases) and changes involving the interaction between the loop and stem structures (3 cases). A pathogenic mutation and its compensating substitution are fixed in a lineage in rapid succession, and often a compensatory interaction evolves convergently in different clades. At least 10%, and perhaps as many as 50%, of all nucleotide substitutions in evolving mammalian tRNAs participate in such interactions, indicating that the evolution of tRNAs proceeds along highly epistatic fitness ridges.},

Here, we present an analysis of population genetic data from intergenic regions and comparisons of these data to previously collected data from introns and exons. Polymorphisms and fixations were categorized as A/T to G/C or G/C to A/T changes and were polarized by inferring the ancestral state using both parsimony and maximum likelihood. Noncoding fixations in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans were consistent with equilibrium base-composition evolution. However, polarized noncoding polymorphisms, revealed a different pattern. Although A/T to G/C and G/C to A/T polymorphisms in D. simulans were consistent with equilibrium, we observed a highly significant dearth of A/T to G/C polymorphisms in D. melanogaster introns but not in intergenic sequences. Such data could be explained by recent evolution of mutational biases associated with transcription or by lineage-specific selection on base composition. These data reveal the complexity of evolutionary processes acting even on noncoding DNA in Drosophila.},

These proteins have a variety of functions and may be subject to sexual selection and/or antagonistic evolution between the sexes. Most population genetic data from these proteins are from D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Here, we extend the population genetic analysis of Acp genes to the other simulans complex species, D. mauritiana and D. sechellia. We sequenced population samples of seven Acp's from D. mauritiana, D. sechellia, and D. simulans. We investigated the population genetics of these genes on individual simulans complex lineages and compared Acp polymorphism and divergence to polymorphism and divergence from a set of non-Acp loci in the same species. Polymorphism and divergence data from the simulans complex revealed little evidence for adaptive protein evolution at individual loci. However, we observed a dramatically inflated index of dispersion for amino acid substitutions in the simulans complex at Acp genes, but not at non-Acp genes. This pattern of episodic bursts of protein evolution in Acp's provides the strongest evidence to date that the population genetic mechanisms driving Acp divergence are different from the mechanisms driving evolution at most Drosophila genes.},

However, the recent ability to compare our genome to that of our closest relative, the chimpanzee, provides new avenues to link genetic and phenotypic changes in the evolution of the human brain. We devised a ranking of regions in the human genome that show significant evolutionary acceleration. Here we report that the most dramatic of these 'human accelerated regions', HAR1, is part of a novel RNA gene (HAR1F) that is expressed specifically in Cajal-Retzius neurons in the developing human neocortex from 7 to 19 gestational weeks, a crucial period for cortical neuron specification and migration. HAR1F is co-expressed with reelin, a product of Cajal-Retzius neurons that is of fundamental importance in specifying the six-layer structure of the human cortex. HAR1 and the other human accelerated regions provide new candidates in the search for uniquely human biology.},

	Abstract = {Population geneticists have long sought to estimate the distribution of selection intensities among genes of diverse function across the genome. Only recently have DNA sequencing and analytical techniques converged to make this possible. Important advances have come from comparing genetic variation within species (polymorphism) with fixed differences between species (divergence). These approaches have been used to examine individual genes for evidence of selection. Here we use the fact that the time since species divergence allows combination of data across genes. In a comparison of amino-acid replacements among species of the mustard weed Arabidopsis with those among species of the fruitfly Drosophila, we find evidence for predominantly beneficial gene substitutions in Drosophila but predominantly detrimental substitutions in Arabidopsis. We attribute this difference to the Arabidopsis mating system of partial self-fertilization, which corroborates a prediction of population genetics theory that species with a high frequency of inbreeding are less efficient in eliminating deleterious mutations owing to their reduced effective population size.},

@article{Sawyer2003,
	Abstract = {One of the principal goals of population genetics is to understand the processes by which genetic variation within species (polymorphism) becomes converted into genetic differences between species (divergence). In this transformation, selective neutrality, near neutrality, and positive selection may each play a role, differing from one gene to the next. Synonymous nucleotide sites are often used as a uniform standard of comparison across genes on the grounds that synonymous sites are subject to relatively weak selective constraints and so may, to a first approximation, be regarded as neutral. Synonymous sites are also interdigitated with nonsynonymous sites and so are affected equally by genomic context and demographic factors. Hence a comparison of levels of polymorphism and divergence between synonymous sites and amino acid replacement sites in a gene is potentially informative about the magnitude of selective forces associated with amino acid replacements. We have analyzed 56 genes in which polymorphism data from D. simulans are compared with divergence from a reference strain of D. melanogaster. The framework of the analysis is Bayesian and assumes that the distribution of selective effects (Malthusian fitnesses) is Gaussian with a mean that differs for each gene. In such a model, the average scaled selection intensity (gamma = N(e)s) of amino acid replacements eligible to become polymorphic or fixed is -7.31, and the standard deviation of selective effects within each locus is 6.79 (assuming homoscedasticity across loci). For newly arising mutations of this type that occur in autosomal or X-linked genes, the average proportion of beneficial mutations is 19.7%. Among the amino acid polymorphisms in the sample, the expected average proportion of beneficial mutations is 47.7%, and among amino acid replacements that become fixed the average proportion of beneficial mutations is 94.3%. The average scaled selection intensity of fixed mutations is +5.1. The presence of positive selection is pervasive with the single exception of kl-5, a Y-linked fertility gene. We find no evidence that a significant fraction of fixed amino acid replacements is neutral or nearly neutral or that positive selection drives amino acid replacements at only a subset of the loci. These results are model dependent and we discuss possible modifications of the model that might allow more neutral and nearly neutral amino acid replacements to be fixed.},

	Abstract = {Identifying regions of the human genome that have been targets of natural selection will provide important insights into human evolutionary history and may facilitate the identification of complex disease genes. Although the signature that natural selection imparts on DNA sequence variation is difficult to disentangle from the effects of neutral processes such as population demographic history, selective and demographic forces can be distinguished by analyzing multiple loci dispersed throughout the genome. We studied the molecular evolution of 132 genes by comprehensively resequencing them in 24 African-Americans and 23 European-Americans. We developed a rigorous computational approach for taking into account multiple hypothesis tests and demographic history and found that while many apparent selective events can instead be explained by demography, there is also strong evidence for positive or balancing selection at eight genes in the European-American population, but none in the African-American population. Our results suggest that the migration of modern humans out of Africa into new environments was accompanied by genetic adaptations to emergent selective forces. In addition, a region containing four contiguous genes on Chromosome 7 showed striking evidence of a recent selective sweep in European-Americans. More generally, our results have important implications for mapping genes underlying complex human diseases.},

	Abstract = {Noncoding genetic variants are likely to influence human biology and disease, but recognizing functional noncoding variants is difficult. Approximately 3% of noncoding sequence is conserved among distantly related mammals, suggesting that these evolutionarily conserved noncoding regions (CNCs) are selectively constrained and contain functional variation. However, CNCs could also merely represent regions with lower local mutation rates. Here we address this issue and show that CNCs are selectively constrained in humans by analyzing HapMap genotype data. Specifically, new (derived) alleles of SNPs within CNCs are rarer than new alleles in nonconserved regions (P = 3 x 10(-18)), indicating that evolutionary pressure has suppressed CNC-derived allele frequencies. Intronic CNCs and CNCs near genes show greater allele frequency shifts, with magnitudes comparable to those for missense variants. Thus, conserved noncoding variants are more likely to be functional. Allele frequency distributions highlight selectively constrained genomic regions that should be intensively surveyed for functionally important variation.},

	Abstract = {The identification of ultraconserved noncoding sequences in vertebrates has been associated with developmental regulators and DNA-binding proteins. One of the first of these was identified in the intergenic region between the Dlx-5 and Dlx-6 genes, members of the Dlx/dll homeodomain-containing protein family. In previous experiments, we showed that Sonic hedgehog treatment of forebrain neural explants results in the activation of Dlx-2 and the novel noncoding RNA (ncRNA), Evf-1. In this report, we show that the Dlx-5/6 ultraconserved region is transcribed to generate an alternatively spliced form of Evf-1, the ncRNA Evf-2. Evf-2 specifically cooperates with Dlx-2 to increase the transcriptional activity of the Dlx-5/6 enhancer in a target and homeodomain-specific manner. A stable complex containing the Evf-2 ncRNA and the Dlx-2 protein forms in vivo, suggesting that the Evf-2 ncRNA activates transcriptional activity by directly influencing Dlx-2 activity. These experiments identify a novel mechanism whereby transcription is controlled by the cooperative actions of an ncRNA and a homeodomain protein. The possibility that a subset of vertebrate ultraconserved regions may function at both the DNA and RNA level to control key developmental regulators may explain why ultraconserved sequences exhibit 90% or more conservation even after 450 million years of vertebrate evolution.},

	Abstract = {Genomic sequence comparisons among human, mouse, and pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes (Fugu)) have revealed a set of extremely conserved noncoding sequences. While this high degree of sequence conservation suggests severe evolutionary constraint and predicts a lack of tolerance to change to retain in vivo functionality, such elements have been minimally explored experimentally. In this study, we describe the in-depth characterization of an ancient conserved enhancer, Dc2, located near the dachshund gene, which displays a human-Fugu identity of 84% over 424 basepairs (bp). In addition to this large overall conservation, we find that Dc2 is characterized by the presence of a large block of sequence (144 bp) that is completely identical among human, mouse, chicken, zebrafish, and Fugu. Through the testing of reporter vector constructs in transgenic mice, we observed that the 424-bp Dc2-conserved element is necessary and sufficient for brain tissue enhancer activity. In vivo analyses also revealed that the 144-bp 100% conserved sequence is necessary, but not sufficient, to replicate Dc2 enhancer function. However, the introduction of two separate 16-bp insertions into the highly conserved enhancer core did not cause any detectable modification of its in vivo activity. Our observations indicate that the 144-bp 100% conserved element is tolerant of change at least at the resolution of this transgenic mouse assay and suggest that purifying selection on the Dc2 sequence might not be as strong as we predicted or that some unknown property also constrains this highly conserved enhancer sequence.},

First discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans, over 2500 microRNAs have been isolated in metazoans and plants; it has been estimated that there may be more than a thousand microRNA genes in the human genome alone. Motivated by the experimental observation of strong conservation of the microRNA let-7 among nearly all metazoans, we developed a novel methodology to characterize the class of such strongly conserved sequences: we identified a non-redundant set of all sequences 20 to 29 bases in length that are shared among three insects: fly, bee and mosquito. Among the few hundred sequences greater than 20 bases in length are close to 40% of the 78 confirmed fly microRNAs, along with other non-coding RNAs and coding sequence.},

	Abstract = {Hundreds of highly conserved distal cis-regulatory elements have been characterized so far in vertebrate genomes. Many thousands more are predicted on the basis of comparative genomics. However, in stark contrast to the genes that they regulate, in invertebrates virtually none of these regions can be traced by using sequence similarity, leaving their evolutionary origins obscure. Here we show that a class of conserved, primarily non-coding regions in tetrapods originated from a previously unknown short interspersed repetitive element (SINE) retroposon family that was active in the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes and terrestrial vertebrates) in the Silurian period at least 410 million years ago (ref. 4), and seems to be recently active in the 'living fossil' Indonesian coelacanth, Latimeria menadoensis. Using a mouse enhancer assay we show that one copy, 0.5 million bases from the neuro-developmental gene ISL1, is an enhancer that recapitulates multiple aspects of Isl1 expression patterns. Several other copies represent new, possibly regulatory, alternatively spliced exons in the middle of pre-existing Sarcopterygian genes. One of these, a more than 200-base-pair ultraconserved region, 100% identical in mammals, and 80% identical to the coelacanth SINE, contains a 31-amino-acid-residue alternatively spliced exon of the messenger RNA processing gene PCBP2 (ref. 6). These add to a growing list of examples in which relics of transposable elements have acquired a function that serves their host, a process termed 'exaptation', and provide an origin for at least some of the many highly conserved vertebrate-specific genomic sequences.},

Nearly all of these segments are also conserved in the chicken and dog genomes, with an average of 95 and 99% identity, respectively. Many are also significantly conserved in fish. These ultraconserved elements of the human genome are most often located either overlapping exons in genes involved in RNA processing or in introns or nearby genes involved in the regulation of transcription and development. Along with more than 5000 sequences of over 100 bp that are absolutely conserved among the three sequenced mammals, these represent a class of genetic elements whose functions and evolutionary origins are yet to be determined, but which are more highly conserved between these species than are proteins and appear to be essential for the ontogeny of mammals and other vertebrates.},

A smoothing algorithm is described which can be used to reconstruct the hidden process and produce graphic displays of the compositional structure of a sequence. The problem of parameter estimation is approached using likelihood methods and an EM algorithm for approximating the maximum likelihood estimate is derived.

The overall likelihood of phylogeny is calculated as a sum of terms, each term being the probability of the data given a particular assignment of rates to sites, times the prior probability of that particular combination of rates. The probabilities of different rate combinations are specified by a stationary Markov chain that assigns rate categories to sites. While there will be a very large number of possible ways of assigning rates to sites, a simple recursive algorithm allows the contributions to the likelihood from all possible combinations of rates to be summed, in a time proportional to the number of different rates at a single site. Thus with three rates, the effort involved is no greater than three times that for a single rate. This "Hidden Markov Model" method allows for rates to differ between sites and for correlations between the rates of neighboring sites. By summing over all possibilities it does not require us to know the rates at individual sites. However, it does not allow for correlation of rates at nonadjacent sites, nor does it allow for a continuous distribution of rates over sites. It is shown how to use the Newton-Raphson method to estimate branch lengths of a phylogeny and to infer from a phylogeny what assignment of rates to sites has the largest posterior probability. An example is given using beta-hemoglobin DNA sequences in eight mammal species; the regions of high and low evolutionary rates are inferred and also the average length of patches of similar rates.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted a comprehensive search for conserved elements in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3%-8% of the human genome (depending on the details of the calibration procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact Drosophila melanogaster (37%-53%), Caenorhabditis elegans (18%-37%), and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae (47%-68%) genomes. From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share certain properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA secondary structure.},

	Abstract = {A few models have appeared in recent years that consider not only the way substitutions occur through evolutionary history at each site of a genome, but also the way the process changes from one site to the next. These models combine phylogenetic models of molecular evolution, which apply to individual sites, and hidden Markov models, which allow for changes from site to site. Besides improving the realism of ordinary phylogenetic models, they are potentially very powerful tools for inference and prediction--for example, for gene finding or prediction of secondary structure. In this paper, we review progress on combined phylogenetic and hidden Markov models and present some extensions to previous work. Our main result is a simple and efficient method for accommodating higher-order states in the HMM, which allows for context-dependent models of substitution--that is, models that consider the effects of neighboring bases on the pattern of substitution. We present experimental results indicating that higher-order states, autocorrelated rates, and multiple functional categories all lead to significant improvements in the fit of a combined phylogenetic and hidden Markov model, with the effect of higher-order states being particularly pronounced.},

	Abstract = {We describe a model for the evolution of DNA sequences by nucleotide substitution, whereby nucleotide sites in the sequence evolve over time, whereas the rates of substitution are variable and correlated over sites. The temporal process used to describe substitutions between nucleotides is a continuous-time Markov process, with the four nucleotides as the states. The spatial process used to describe variation and dependence of substitution rates over sites is based on a serially correlated gamma distribution, i.e., an auto-gamma model assuming Markov-dependence of rates at adjacent sites. To achieve computational efficiency, we use several equal-probability categories to approximate the gamma distribution, and the result is an auto-discrete-gamma model for rates over sites. Correlation of rates at sites then is modeled by the Markov chain transition of rates at adjacent sites from one rate category to another, the states of the chain being the rate categories. Two versions of nonparametric models, which place no restrictions on the distributional forms of rates for sites, also are considered, assuming either independence or Markov dependence. The models are applied to data of a segment of mitochondrial genome from nine primate species. Model parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood method, and models are compared by the likelihood ratio test. Tremendous variation of rates among sites in the sequence is revealed by the analyses, and when rate differences for different codon positions are appropriately accounted for in the models, substitution rates at adjacent sites are found to be strongly (positively) correlated. Robustness of the results to uncertainty of the phylogenetic tree linking the species is examined.},

	Abstract = {The process of strong artificial selection during a domestication event is modeled, and its effect on the pattern of DNA polymorphism is investigated. The model also considers population bottleneck during domestication. Artificial selection during domestication is different from a regular selective sweep because artificial selection acts on alleles that may have been neutral variants before domestication. Therefore, the fixation of such a beneficial allele does not always wipe out DNA variation in the surrounding region. The amount by which variation is reduced largely depends on the initial frequency of the beneficial allele, p. As a consequence, p has a strong effect on the likelihood of detecting the signature of selection during domestication from patterns of polymorphism. These theoretical results are discussed in light of data collected from maize. Although the main focus of this article is on domestication, this model can also be generalized to describe selective sweeps from standing genetic variation.},

	Abstract = {The allele frequency of a neutral variant in a population is pushed either upward or downward by directional selection on a linked beneficial mutation ("selective sweeps"). DNA sequences sampled after the fixation of the beneficial allele thus contain an excess of rare neutral alleles. This study investigates the allele frequency distribution under selective sweep models using analytic approximation and simulation. First, given a single selective sweep at a fixed time, I derive an expression for the sampling probabilities of neutral mutants. This solution can be used to estimate the time of the fixation of a beneficial allele from sequence data. Next, I obtain an approximation to mean allele frequencies under recurrent selective sweeps. Under recurrent sweeps, the frequency spectrum is skewed toward rare alleles. However, the excess of high-frequency derived alleles, previously shown to be a signature of single selective sweeps, disappears with recurrent sweeps. It is shown that, using this approximation and multilocus polymorphism data, genomewide parameters of directional selection can be estimated.},

	Abstract = {The hitchhiking effect of a beneficial mutation, or a selective sweep, generates a unique distribution of allele frequencies and spatial distribution of polymorphic sites. A composite-likelihood test was previously designed to detect these signatures of a selective sweep, solely on the basis of the spatial distribution and marginal allele frequencies of polymorphisms. As an excess of linkage disequilibrium (LD) is also known to be a strong signature of a selective sweep, we investigate how much statistical power is increased by the inclusion of information regarding LD. The expected pattern of LD is predicted by a genealogical approach. Both theory and simulation suggest that strong LD is generated in narrow regions at both sides of the location of beneficial mutation. However, a lack of LD is expected across the two sides. We explore various ways to detect this signature of selective sweeps by statistical tests. A new composite-likelihood method is proposed to incorporate information regarding LD. This method enables us to detect selective sweeps and estimate the parameters of the selection model better than the previous composite-likelihood method that does not take LD into account. However, the improvement made by including LD is rather small, suggesting that most of the relevant information regarding selective sweeps is captured by the spatial distribution and marginal allele frequencies of polymorphisms.},

	Abstract = {Detecting selective sweeps from genomic SNP data is complicated by the intricate ascertainment schemes used to discover SNPs, and by the confounding influence of the underlying complex demographics and varying mutation and recombination rates. Current methods for detecting selective sweeps have little or no robustness to the demographic assumptions and varying recombination rates, and provide no method for correcting for ascertainment biases. Here, we present several new tests aimed at detecting selective sweeps from genomic SNP data. Using extensive simulations, we show that a new parametric test, based on composite likelihood, has a high power to detect selective sweeps and is surprisingly robust to assumptions regarding recombination rates and demography (i.e., has low Type I error). Our new test also provides estimates of the location of the selective sweep(s) and the magnitude of the selection coefficient. To illustrate the method, we apply our approach to data from the Seattle SNP project and to Chromosome 2 data from the HapMap project. In Chromosome 2, the most extreme signal is found in the lactase gene, which previously has been shown to be undergoing positive selection. Evidence for selective sweeps is also found in many other regions, including genes known to be associated with disease risk such as DPP10 and COL4A3.},

	Abstract = {In the classical model of genetic drift in population genetics theory, use is made of a hypothetical "infinite-gametic pool". If, instead, the gametic pool is determined by the random number of offspring per individual, a new form of natural selection acting on the variance in offspring number occurs. A diffusion model of this selection process is derived and some of its properties are explored. It is shown that, independent of the sampling scheme used, the diffusion equation has the drift coefficient M(p) = p(1-p) (mul--mu2 + sigma2e2--sigma2el) and the diffusion coefficient v(p) equals p(1-p) [psigma2e2 + (l--p)sigma2el]. It is also pointed out that the Direct Product Branching process model of genetic drift introduces a non-biological interaction between individuals and is thus inappropriate for modeling natural selection.},

	Abstract = {A statistical analysis of DNA sequences from four nuclear loci and five mitochondrial loci from different orders of mammals is described. A major aim of the study is to describe the variation in the rate of molecular evolution of proteins and DNA. A measure of rate variability is the statistic R, the ratio of the variance in the number of substitutions to the mean number. For proteins, R is found to be in the range 0.16 less than R less than 35.55, thus extending in both directions the values seen in previous studies. An analysis of codons shows that there is a highly significant excess of double substitutions in the first and second positions, but not in the second and third or first and third positions. The analysis of the dynamics of nucleotide evolution showed that the ergodic Markov chain models that are the basis of most published formulas for correcting for multiple substitutions are incompatible with the data. A bootstrap procedure was used to show that the evolution of the individual nucleotides, even the third positions, show the same variation in rates as seen in the proteins. It is argued that protein and silent DNA evolution are uncoupled, with the evolution at both levels showing patterns that are better explained by the action of natural selection than by neutrality. This conclusion is based primarily on a comparison of the nuclear and mitochondrial results.},

	Abstract = {This paper concludes that the statistical properties of protein evolution are compatible with a particular model of evolution by natural selection. The argument begins with a statistical description of the molecular clock based on a Poisson process with a randomly varying tick rate. If the time scale of the change of the tick rate of the molecular clock is assumed to be much less than the average time between substitutions, then it is shown that the substitution process must be episodic, with bursts of substitutions being separated by long periods of time with no substitutions. This analysis generalizes the recent work of Gillespie (1984a). The second part of the argument shows that a simple model of evolution by natural selection--one that incorporates a changing environment, the molecular landscape, and a simple form of epistasis--exhibits dynamics that are identical to those inferred from the statistical analysis. This leads to the conclusion that natural selection is a viable explanation for protein evolution. In addition, a correction formula for multiple substitutions is given that does not require that the substitution process be a Poisson process, and some comments on the inability of the neutral allele theory to account for the dynamics of the substitution process are presented.},

	Abstract = {Recent efforts to estimate the index of dispersion {$[$}R(t){$]$} of molecular evolution-i.e., the ratio of the variance in the number of substitutions on a lineage to the mean number-have suffered from an inability to adjust the data for lineage effects. These effects may include the generation-time dependency of the rate of evolution or improper assumptions about the branching pattern of a phylogenetic tree. In the present paper a method for correcting for lineage effects in the estimation of R(t) is presented for trees made up of three species. The recent data published by Li et al. for 20 loci in three orders of mammals is examined, and the average R(t), corrected for lineage effects, is shown to be 7.75 for replacement substitutions and 3.3 for silent substitutions. Thus the high values reported earlier may not be dismissed as due to generation-time effects or improper assumptions about phylogenies. Computer simulations are presented to give confidence in the estimate for replacement substitutions but also to demonstrate that the estimate for silent substitutions is sensitive to corrections for multiple substitutions and is not as reliable. This work's implications for our understanding of the mechanism of molecular evolution are discussed, and the arguments in favor of the hypothesis that replacement substitutions are mostly selected while silent substitutions are mostly neutral is presented.},

	Abstract = {A model of molecular evolution is presented that is based on the combined action of natural selection, genetic drift, and mutation. The mathematical description of the model uses strong-selection, weak-mutation limits to approximate the dynamics of multidimensional diffusion processes with one dimensional Markov chains. This approach leads to a great simplification of the dynamics and provides a unified method for describing many different mechanisms of natural selection. In this paper two models are examined, one based on selection in a randomly fluctuating environment, the other on overdominance. Both models exhibit similar dynamics, with a rapid buildup phase that introduces new alleles into the population, followed by a relatively quiescent phase where new alleles may enter and leave the population at a low rate. If occasional extreme environmental changes occur that favor particular alleles, the resulting dynamics turn out to be in remarkable agreement with many of the observations on molecular evolution and polymorphism. Thus the model is at least as successful as the neutral theory in accounting for evolutionary events at the molecular level.},

For rapidly fluctuating environments, substitutions are more regular than random. A small mutation-rate approximation is used to explain the regularity. The explanation does not depend heavily on the particulars of the haploid model, leading to the conjecture that many symmetrical models of molecular evolution with rapidly changing parameters may exhibit substitutions that are more regular than random. When fitnesses change very slowly, the simulation shows that substitutions are more clumped than random. Here a small-mutation approximation shows that the clustering is due to the increase in fitness that accompanies each successive substitution with a consequent lowering of the effective mutation rate. The two observations taken together suggest that the common observation that amino acid substitutions are clustered in time is due to the presence of parameters that change very slowly.},

	Abstract = {The substitution processes for various models of deleterious alleles are examined using computer simulations and mathematical analyses. Most of the work focuses on the house-of-cards model, which is a popular model of deleterious allele evolution. The rate of substitution is shown to be a concave function of the strength of selection as measured by alpha = 2N sigma, where N is the population size and sigma is the standard deviation of fitness. For alpha < 1, the house-of-cards model is essentially a neutral model; for alpha > 4, the model ceases to evolve. The stagnation for large alpha may be understood by appealing to the theory of records. The house-of-cards model evolves to a state where the vast majority of all mutations are deleterious, but precisely one-half of those mutations that fix are deleterious (the other half are advantageous). Thus, the model is not a model of exclusively deleterious evolution as is frequently claimed. It is argued that there are no biologically reasonable models of molecular evolution where the vast majority of all substitutions are deleterious. Other models examined include the exponential and gamma shift models, the Hartl-Dykhuizen-Dean (HDD) model, and the optimum model. Of all those examined, only the optimum and HDD models appear to be reasonable candidates for silent evolution. None of the models are viewed as good candidates for protein evolution, as none are both biologically reasonable and exhibit the variability in substitutions commonly observed in protein sequence data.},

Similarly, an examination of the effects of linked selection on the non-random association of mutations at two linked neutral loci did not suggest that this property would be useful for inferring the nature of linked selection either. Linked selection may have a profound effect on the 'effective population size' of the neutral locus.

If the mutation rate and strength of selection are held fixed and the population size increased, the eight models examined fall into three domains based on their rates of substitution. In the Ohta domain, the rate of substitution decreases with increasing population size; in the Kimura domain, the rate of substitution remains close to the mutation rate; in the Darwin domain, the rate of substitution increases without bound. In the Kimura and Darwin domains, the rate of substitution is much less sensitive to the population size than suggested by two-allele theories. Remarkably, the overdominance model converges to the neutral model with increasing N. The variation at a neutral locus linked to a selected locus is found to be insensitive to the population size for certain models of selection. A selected locus can actually cause the rate of substitution of deleterious alleles at a linked locus to increase with increasing population size. These unexpected results illustrate that intuition based on two-allele theory is often misleading.},

The pseudohitchhiking model is a one-locus model that approximates these effects and can be used to describe the major consequences of linked selection. As the changes in neutral allele frequencies when hitchhiking are rapid, diffusion theory is not appropriate for studying neutral dynamics. A stationary distribution and some results on substitution processes are presented that use the theory of continuous-time Markov processes with discontinuous sample paths. The coalescent of the pseudohitchhiking model is shown to have a random number of branches at each node, which leads to a frequency spectrum that is different from that of the equilibrium neutral model.

The fact that heterozygosities in natural populations are only weakly dependent on population size suggests that genetic draft may be a much more important stochastic force than genetic drift in natural populations. Some of the mathematical properties of genetic draft are explored.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines aspects of genetic draft, the stochastic force induced by substitutions at one locus on the dynamics of a closely linked locus. Of particular interest is the role of population size on genetic draft. Remarkably, the rate of substitution of weakly selected advantageous mutations decreases with increasing population size, whereas that for deleterious mutations increases with population size. This dependency on population size is the opposite of that for genetic drift. Moreover, these rates are only weakly dependent on population size, again contrary to the strong dependency of drift-based dynamics. Four models of the strongly selected loci responsible for genetic draft are examined. Three of these exhibit a very weak dependency on population size, which implies that their induced effects will also be weakly dependent on population size. Together, these results suggest that population size and binomial sampling may not be relevant to a species' evolution. If this is the case, then a number of evolutionary conundrums are resolved.},

Furthermore, theoretical analysis of samples from neutral phylogenies shows that these samples should not appear to be samples from a Poisson process, but should deviate from a Poisson process in the same direction, though perhaps not to the same extent, as do the data.},

Emphasis is placed on the nearly neutral theory, as this version of the neutral theory has explained the widest range of phenomena. The shift of interest from protein to DNA evolution is chronicled, leading to the modern view that silent and replacement substitutions are responding to different evolutionary forces. However, the exact nature and magnitude of these forces remains controversial, as all current theoretical models suffer either from assumptions that are not quite realistic or from an inability to account readily for all phenomena. Although the gathering of sequence data has been the main effort of contemporary population genetics, further exploration of theoretical models of molecular evolution would provide a more coherent framework for data analysis.},

We also discuss the coverage of confidence intervals on the basis of two standard-likelihood methods. We find that the LRT has high power to detect deviations from neutrality and that the maximum-likelihood estimation performs very well when the ancestral states of all mutations in the sample are known. When the ancestral states are not known, the test has high power to detect deviations from neutrality for negative selection but not for positive selection.

	Abstract = {We develop a Poisson random-field model of polymorphism and divergence that allows arbitrary dominance relations in a diploid context. This model provides a maximum-likelihood framework for estimating both selection and dominance parameters of new mutations using information on the frequency spectrum of sequence polymorphisms. This is the first DNA sequence-based estimator of the dominance parameter. Our model also leads to a likelihood-ratio test for distinguishing nongenic from genic selection; simulations indicate that this test is quite powerful when a large number of segregating sites are available. We also use simulations to explore the bias in selection parameter estimates caused by unacknowledged dominance relations. When inference is based on the frequency spectrum of polymorphisms, genic selection estimates of the selection parameter can be very strongly biased even for minor deviations from the genic selection model. Surprisingly, however, when inference is based on polymorphism and divergence (McDonald-Kreitman) data, genic selection estimates of the selection parameter are nearly unbiased, even for completely dominant or recessive mutations. Further, we find that weak overdominant selection can increase, rather than decrease, the substitution rate relative to levels of polymorphism. This nonintuitive result has major implications for the interpretation of several popular tests of neutrality.},

	Abstract = {Natural selection and demographic forces can have similar effects on patterns of DNA polymorphism. Therefore, to infer selection from samples of DNA sequences, one must simultaneously account for demographic effects. Here we take a model-based approach to this problem by developing predictions for patterns of polymorphism in the presence of both population size change and natural selection. If data are available from different functional classes of variation, and a priori information suggests that mutations in one of those classes are selectively neutral, then the putatively neutral class can be used to infer demographic parameters, and inferences regarding selection on other classes can be performed given demographic parameter estimates. This procedure is more robust to assumptions regarding the true underlying demography than previous approaches to detecting and analyzing selection. We apply this method to a large polymorphism data set from 301 human genes and find (i) widespread negative selection acting on standing nonsynonymous variation, (ii) that the fitness effects of nonsynonymous mutations are well predicted by several measures of amino acid exchangeability, especially site-specific methods, and (iii) strong evidence for very recent population growth.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel composite-likelihood-ratio test (CLRT) for detecting genes and genomic regions that are subject to recurrent natural selection (either positive or negative). The method uses the likelihood functions of Hartl et al. (1994) for inference in a Wright-Fisher genic selection model and corrects for nonindependence among sites by application of coalescent simulations with recombination. Here, we (1) characterize the distribution of the CLRT statistic (Lambda) as a function of the population recombination rate (R=4Ner); (2) explore the effects of bias in estimation of R on the size (type I error) of the CLRT; (3) explore the robustness of the model to population growth, bottlenecks, and migration; (4) explore the power of the CLRT under varying levels of mutation, selection, and recombination; (5) explore the discriminatory power of the test in distinguishing negative selection from population growth; and (6) evaluate the performance of maximum composite-likelihood estimation (MCLE) of the selection coefficient. We find that the test has excellent power to detect weak negative selection and moderate power to detect positive selection. Moreover, the test is quite robust to bias in the estimate of local recombination rate, but not to certain demographic scenarios such as population growth or a recent bottleneck. Last, we demonstrate that the MCLE of the selection parameter has little bias for weak negative selection and has downward bias for positively selected mutations.},

	Abstract = {In 2002 Kim and Stephan proposed a promising composite-likelihood method for localizing and estimating the fitness advantage of a recently fixed beneficial mutation. Here, we demonstrate that their composite-likelihood-ratio (CLR) test comparing selective and neutral hypotheses is not robust to undetected population structure or a recent bottleneck, with some parameter combinations resulting in a false positive rate of nearly 90%. We also propose a goodness-of-fit test for discriminating rejections due to directional selection (true positive) from those due to population and demographic forces (false positives) and demonstrate that the new method has high sensitivity to differentiate the two classes of rejections.},

	Abstract = {Recurrent directional selection on a partially recombining chromosome may cause a substantial reduction of standing genetic variation in natural populations. Previous studies of this effect, commonly called selective sweeps, assumed that at most one beneficial allele is on the way to fixation at a given time. However, for a high rate of selected substitutions and a low recombination rate, this assumption can easily be violated. We investigated this problem using full-forward simulations and analytical approximations. We found that interference between linked beneficial alleles causes a reduction of their fixation probabilities. The hitchhiking effect on linked neutral variation for a given substitution also slightly decreases due to interference. As a result, the strength of recurrent selective sweeps is weakened. However, this effect is significant only in chromosomal regions of relatively low recombination rates where the level of variation is greatly reduced. Therefore, previous results on recurrent selective sweeps although derived for a restricted parameter range are still valid. Analytical approximations are obtained for the case of complete linkage for which interference between competing beneficial alleles is maximal.},

	Abstract = {The theory of genetic hitchhiking predicts that the level of genetic variation is greatly reduced at the site of strong directional selection and increases as the recombinational distance from the site of selection increases. This characteristic pattern can be used to detect recent directional selection on the basis of DNA polymorphism data. However, the large variance of nucleotide diversity in samples of moderate size imposes difficulties in detecting such patterns. We investigated the patterns of genetic variation along a recombining chromosome by constructing ancestral recombination graphs that are modified to incorporate the effect of genetic hitchhiking. A statistical method is proposed to test the significance of a local reduction of variation and a skew of the frequency spectrum caused by a hitchhiking event. This method also allows us to estimate the strength and the location of directional selection from DNA sequence data.},

	Abstract = {The development of statistical tests of natural selection at the DNA level in population samples has been ongoing for the past 13 years. The current state of the field is reviewed, and the available tests of selection are described. All tests use predictions from the theory of neutrally evolving sites as a null hypothesis. Departures from equilibrium-neutral expectations can indicate the presence of natural selection acting either at one or more of the sites under investigation or at a sufficiently tightly linked site. Complications can arise in the interpretation of departures from neutrality if populations are not at equilibrium for mutation and genetic drift or if populations are subdivided, both of which are likely scenarios for humans. Attempts to understand the nonequilibrium configuration of silent polymorphism in human mitochondrial DNA illustrate the difficulty of distinguishing between selection and alternative demographic hypotheses. The range of plausible alternatives to selection will become better defined, however, as additional population genetic data sets become available, allowing better null models to be constructed.},
