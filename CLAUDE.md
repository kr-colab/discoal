# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current Work Status (as of latest fixes on `mem` branch)

### Recent Memory Optimizations
1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation** (previous commits)
   - Converted fixed arrays to dynamic allocation for nodes, breakpoints, mutations
   - Reduced baseline memory from ~400MB to ~10MB
   - Achieved 15-93% memory savings across test cases

2. **Memory-Mapped Trajectory Storage** (commit df6368b)
   - Implemented file-backed mmap for sweep trajectories
   - Trajectories write directly to temp files during generation
   - Accepted trajectories are memory-mapped for reading
   - Reduced memory usage from ~2GB to ~1.4MB for medium sweeps (99.9% reduction)
   - Enables previously impossible large sweep simulations

3. **Fixed RNG Corruption Bug** (previous fix)
   - Changed `malloc` to `calloc` in `initializeAncSites()` function
   - Resolved output differences between optimized and legacy versions
   - Fixed memory explosion in admixture_model test (4.6GB â†’ 3.4MB)
   - All 21 comprehensive tests now produce identical output

4. **Ancestry Segment Tree Implementation** (current commit)
   - Implemented succinct tree structure for tracking ancestral segments
   - Proper interval merging with sweep-line algorithm and automatic coalescing
   - Reference counting infrastructure for future segment sharing
   - Wrapper functions enable gradual migration from ancSites arrays
   - Currently maintains both representations for validation (8% overhead)
   - Foundation for significant memory savings once arrays are removed

### Test Results Summary
- **Success Rate**: 21/21 tests pass (100%) for both versions
- **Output Compatibility**: 21/21 tests produce identical output
- **Memory Improvements**: 16/21 tests show memory savings (average 9%)
  - Multipop models: up to 58% reduction
  - Selection sweeps: up to 52% reduction
  - High recombination: 16% reduction

### Tree-Only Mode Implementation (USE_ANCESTRY_TREE_ONLY)
- Implemented complete ancSites replacement with ancestry segment trees
- All functions updated to work with tree-only mode:
  - Coalescence (regular and sweep)
  - Recombination (regular and sweep)
  - Gene conversion (regular and sweep)
- Tree-only version passes all 21 comprehensive tests with identical output
- Can be built with: `make discoal_tree_only`
- Provides foundation for future memory optimization through segment sharing

### Active TODOs
- [ ] Clean up test artifacts and temporary files
- [ ] Complete removal of ancSites array from main codebase
- [ ] Implement segment sharing using reference counting for memory optimization
- [ ] Document memory optimization techniques in main README

### Implementation Details
- Trajectory files: `/tmp/discoal_traj_<pid>_<time>_<rand>.tmp`
- Rejected trajectories cleaned up immediately
- Signal handlers ensure cleanup on exit
- 500M step safety limit prevents runaway trajectories
- All dynamic arrays now use `calloc` for zero-initialization
- Ancestry segment trees use interval-based representation with coalescing
- Reference counting enables future copy-on-write optimizations
- Wrapper functions in `ancestryWrapper.h` for gradual migration
- Debug builds include ancestry verification between representations

### Known Issues
- Test executables must be named `discoal_edited` and `discoal_legacy_backup`

## Directory Structure

**IMPORTANT**: When working with bash commands, be aware of the directory structure:
- **Root directory** (`/Users/adk/github/discoal/`): Contains source files, Makefile, and main executables
- **Testing directory** (`/Users/adk/github/discoal/testing/`): Contains all test scripts
- **Unit test directory** (`/Users/adk/github/discoal/test/unit/`): Contains unit test files

**Note about shell sessions**: The bash tool maintains persistent state, so after `cd testing/`, subsequent commands run in that directory. To avoid confusion:
- Use absolute paths when possible
- Or explicitly return to root with `cd ..` or `cd /Users/adk/github/discoal`
- Check current directory with `pwd` if uncertain

## Build Commands

- `make discoal` - Build the main discoal executable
- `make discoal_tree_only` - Build tree-only version (ancSites replaced with ancestry trees)
- `make clean` - Remove all build artifacts
- `make run_tests` - Build and run all unit tests
- Individual unit tests: `make test_node`, `make test_event`, `make test_mutations`, `make test_node_operations`

## Testing

**IMPORTANT: Always run the comprehensive testing suite when making changes to ensure no regressions.**

### Comprehensive Testing Framework (PRIMARY)
The comprehensive testing suite in `testing/` directory is based on all documented examples and must be run for any changes:

**Quick validation (use during development):**
```bash
cd testing/
./focused_validation_suite.sh
```

**Full validation (required before commits):**
```bash
cd testing/
./comprehensive_validation_suite.sh
```

The testing framework:
- Tests all documented functionality from discoaldoc.tex
- Compares optimized vs legacy versions for identical output
- Profiles memory usage and detects regressions
- Provides 21 comprehensive test cases covering all features
- Ensures trajectory optimization maintains compatibility

### Unit Tests
Unit tests use a custom Unity testing framework in `test/unit/unity.h`. Tests are located in `test/unit/`:
- `test_node.c` - Tests rootedNode structure operations
- `test_mutations.c` - Tests mutation handling
- `test_event.c` - Tests event structure
- `test_node_operations.c` - Tests node operations

### Legacy Integration Tests
Bash scripts in root directory test different aspects:
- Performance: `test_performance_*.sh`
- Memory: `test_memory_*.sh`, `test_memory_leaks.sh`
- Features: `test_recomb_*.sh`, `test_muts_*.sh`, `test_gene_conversion.sh`
- Stress: `test_stress_muts.sh`, `test_extreme_stress_muts.sh`

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **discoal_multipop.c** - Main program entry point with command-line parsing and simulation loop
2. **discoalFunctions.c** - Core simulation functions (coalescence, recombination, mutations)
3. **alleleTraj.c** - Allele trajectory calculations for sweep simulations
4. **ranlibComplete.c** - Random number generation library

### Key Data Structures

- **rootedNode** (`discoal.h:34-52`) - Core coalescent tree node with:
  - Recombination support (left/right parents and children)
  - Dynamic arrays for mutations (`muts`) and ancestral sites (`ancSites`)
  - Memory management with capacity tracking
  - Population and sweep population tracking

- **event** (`discoal.h:60-68`) - Demographic events (population size changes, splits, admixture)

### Memory Management

The codebase has been optimized for memory efficiency:
- Dynamic allocation for breakpoints, mutations, and ancestral sites
- Capacity tracking with `*Capacity` fields in structures
- Memory allocation functions: `initialize*()`, `ensure*Capacity()`, `cleanup*()`
- Memory-mapped files for large trajectory arrays
- Multiple executable versions exist for comparison (legacy vs optimized)

### Trajectory Storage (NEW)
- Sweep trajectories written to temporary files during generation
- Files are memory-mapped read-only after acceptance
- Rejected trajectories cleaned up immediately
- Signal handlers ensure cleanup on exit/interrupt

### Simulation Architecture

1. **Parameter parsing** in main()
2. **Initialization** of global arrays and structures
3. **Event-driven simulation** processing demographic events chronologically
4. **Coalescent process** with recombination and mutation
5. **Output generation** in ms format or tree format (with `-T` flag)

### Key Global Variables

- `nodes[]` - Active nodes in coalescent tree (dynamically allocated)
- `breakPoints[]` - Recombination breakpoints (dynamically allocated)
- `activeMaterial[]` - Tracks which sites have ancestral material
- `events[]` - Array of demographic events sorted by time
- `currentTrajectory` - Memory-mapped pointer to trajectory data
- `trajectoryFd` - File descriptor for mmap'd trajectory

## Code Conventions

- C style with global variables for simulation state
- Memory-efficient dynamic allocation patterns
- Extensive use of function pointers for different simulation modes
- Consistent naming: `*AtTime*()` for time-based operations, `*Popn*()` for population-specific operations

## Development Workflow

### Required Testing Workflow
1. **During development**: Run `cd testing/ && ./focused_validation_suite.sh` frequently
2. **Before commits**: Run `cd testing/ && ./comprehensive_validation_suite.sh` to ensure no regressions
3. **After major changes**: Run full comprehensive suite and document any performance improvements
4. **Never commit without validation**: The testing suite must pass before any code changes are committed

### Optimization Guidelines
- Always establish baseline performance with testing suite before optimization
- Use focused testing suite for rapid iteration during optimization work
- Document memory savings and success rate improvements in commit messages
- Update test cases when adding new functionality
- Maintain backward compatibility verified through identical output comparison

## Git Workflow and Branch Management

### Branch Strategy
- **master branch**: Protected baseline containing stable legacy code for comparison
- **Feature branches** (e.g., `mem`, `optimization`, etc.): Active development branches
- **NEVER commit to master**: All development work must be done on feature branches

### Legacy Testing Convention
- Legacy binary (`discoal_legacy_backup`) is automatically built from master branch
- This ensures consistent baseline for functional compatibility testing
- Master branch serves as the "source of truth" for original functionality
- All optimizations must maintain identical output to master branch version

### Commit Guidelines
- Only commit to feature branches, never to master
- When making commits, don't add Claude as a co-author
- Run testing suite before all commits to ensure no regressions
- Document optimization benefits and performance improvements in commit messages

### Testing Requirements
- Legacy version always built from master branch via `git show master:filename`
- Optimized version built from current working branch
- All tests compare feature branch (optimized) vs master branch (legacy)
- This guarantees that optimizations maintain compatibility with baseline functionality
